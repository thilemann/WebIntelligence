summary: Great price on a Great product
review: My 4 border collies expect one of these each night before bed.  I've learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active "wired" dogs calm, and there's no way I have time to brush their teeth each nite, even if they'd let me.  But this can get very expensive.  When I found them here at this price, I ordered tons.  Then went back and ordered more, figuring the price would increase to that on other sites.  It had increased a bit, but still a great price. Entirely Pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems, but that was okay since I had just received enough to last a month!

summary: Best instant coffee anywhere!
review: Without reservation, this is the best instant coffee I have ever tasted. I have consumed coffee in many different countries during over 40 years of travel. Starbucks has created a masterpiece with this product. It is a bit expensive, but well worth the cost.

summary: Excellent product!!
review: I started my son on this powdered milk and he transitioned easily from breast milk without any problems.  I use a gallon container and mix the whole can (3 quarts) at once with luke warm water and it works out perfectly. I really like this company and their product and love that this milk is also Vit D fortified.  Once my son gets older and he consumes less milk we will transition to the fresh goat milk, since right now it doesn't fit in our budget.

summary: Chocolate Italian kisses - need I say more?
review: My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term "Baci Pill" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!

review: I've been looking for ground celery seed for at least 2 years.  It used to be always be avaialbe at grocery stores with the rest of the spices, but for some reason stopped being there.  Regular celery seed is easy to find, but not the ground version.  So, I found online.  I wanted McCormick (or some familiar brand).  I'm very satisfied with what I ordered - it's very good and fresh.  My only complaint is that I couldn't purchase a smaller quantity than two large 16 oz containers.  I don't use that much, so gave away the one container to a friend, and it will take me years to use 16 oz container that I kept!  :)  But, happy to now have found.  Hope for others that McCormick decides to package in smaller quantities.

summary: Serve On the Rocks
review: I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the "The Switch Orange Tangerine" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about "The Switch"... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with "No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can't see myself drinking "The Switch" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend "The Swtich". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.

summary: Great deal on great tea
review: My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some "loose" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh.

summary: Oh My Goodness~Reminds me of Girl Scout Cookies from 1960's
review: These are so good and also healthy for a snack. Only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories. When I was in Girl Scouts in the 60's there was a cookie like this Savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing. The first bite I took I was back there. It was so good. I love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double. I eat one everyday. They range from $2.98 to $3.89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go. I tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites.<br /><br />If you remember those cookies you will love these. If you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast. You will not regret it. YUMMMMMMMMMMY.

summary: Great toddler snack; inconsistent quality
review: My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.

review: This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.

summary: Folgers Half Caffeine
review: This is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his/her caffeine consumption.  Great tasting coffee and great deal.  Can spend over $5 for it at the grocery store.  I get mine by the subscription plan for a little over $4 plus no tax.

summary: smooth taste, good hot and iced
review: I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta "Riviera Sunset" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced.

review: This is one of the best hot dogs made, unfortunatally it is not widely available.  Citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price.  Granted there is 30+ weiners in a package, still a stupid price.

summary: By far my favorite chips
review: These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.

summary: Pop Chips, yum!
review: I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!

summary: Our baby is perfect
review: Our baby is very happy with his Similac organic ready to drink formula.<br />He is also very happy with the regular formula in the blue bottle, which we feed him when the organic is not available.<br /><br />He did not really like the formula when we had to mix it from powder.<br />He is ten months old now and he rarely spits up, always smiles and is the most content baby anybody has ever seen.<br /><br />I attribute that to awesome parenting and not to the formula.

summary: Perfect for so many things
review: A classic Pasta Amatriciana requires this beautiful and mild form of bacon, and as with every other product I have purchased from them, La Quercia has nailed Guanciale.<br /><br />A little guanciale, rendered a bit but still tender, some diced tomatoes, a little peccorino romano, a pinch of crushed red pepper, and you are done.  The guanciale is the star, and this guanciale really stands up.  Served with bucatini pasta, and you might as well be in Rome.

summary: Another good soup from HC!
review: This soup is good. I really love this brand of soups..my favorite being the Chicken and Dumplings. Healthy Choice isn't always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups. I love them, they taste homemade and amazingly better than Campbell's or Progresso. I recommend this, the Chicken and Dumplings, the Split Pea and Ham...in fact, every variety I've tried has been delicious. You can't really go wrong with this.

summary: GREAT mid morning snack
review: I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee.  They are also great for those mornings you really aren't in the mood for breakfast, but know you'll be hungry later.  They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two.  They do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like.  Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more.

summary: Expensive But Worth It!
review: Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it!  I have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one.  Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.

summary: Fantastic Orange Tea
review: I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than "regular" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas.

summary: Worst cookies ever!!!!!
review: I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage.

summary: Cute, small lollipops, a few arrived broken
review: Got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party, so I haven't actually tasted them. The lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them, which I wish they didn't (would have been much cuter without the writing). They are a bit smaller than I expected (just slightly larger than a regular lollipop), and a few arrived broken, but really, they were well packaged, and looked cute for the party.

summary: THIS PRODUCT WORKS!
review: Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.

summary: Great in juices/water mix!
review: These are great in juice mix.  What I usually do is mix a tablespoon or two in a glass with half-way filled water.  Stir continuously for the next minute or two (this is to keep the seed separated so they don't stick together in small chunks, do this and they will float in the drink mix), then fill up the glass with your prefer choice of juice or organic juice (guava, prune, coconut, etc), stir in a tiny bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014J2UO">KAL - Pure Stevia Extract Powder, 3 oz powder</a>.  Let the drink sit for at least 15 minutes (remember to stir it every minute so that the gel coat on those seeds are formed evenly and they will float).  Drop in a cube or two of ice when ready to serve....you'll be amazed!

summary: Gluten free isn't  always taste free.
review: Due to health issues, my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet. He acted as if he was on death row. Finding this product has help immensely. I can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he doesn't feel he is being unfairly punished. Also, my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance. I shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>

review: They are just that - 100 calorie bags of pretzels. Snyder's tends to have one of the best tasting pretzels according to my taste buds. These bags create instant portion control and are a great value for the price, especially with subscribe and save. I also throw them in the kids' lunch bags and keep some in the car for road trips.

summary: Not So Great
review: The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.<br />The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.

review: This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said "negligible."<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.

review: These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet "Bacon" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that I'm going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many "bacon fanatics" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />CFH

I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said "negligible."<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.

summary: Great Starter plant
review: Item arrived in less than a week. Packaging was great. Old newspaper to fill in black space, and the leaves of the plant were tucked inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed.  There was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity.<br /><br />All leaves were green and healthy, not many traps were closed. It had two adult plant, one juvenile one. I separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot wouldn't have been long enough for their roots (They like over 4 inches of room for their roots if it can be helped). Fast forward 6 months, my collections has grown, and these original Venus Fly Traps have  been propagating with secondary growth points. They're growing like weeds!<br /><br />Don't forget, they like sun and distilled water. But be careful when you first get them. Put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning.

summary: Wonderful beef jerky...an addiction waiting to happen!
review: I am not Muslim, but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of "sweet" jerky out there.  It has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor (spicy...but NOT hot)!  It is easy to chew and doesn't leave your fingers sticky. I wish it came in more economical sizes (6, 9, or 12 oz sizes), but that doesn't seem to be the case.  It's a great jerky and might just be addictive, which probably makes the 3 ounces bag size a good choice...after the first 3 ounces you HAVE TO STOP (at least long enough to open another bag)!!!

summary: Spews coffee grounds inside Keurig machine K-cup holder and down into my coffee every time!
review: I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend.

summary: KEEBLER SOFT BATCH CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES 15-OUNCE(PACK OF 6)
review: A very soft, very delicious Keebler Brand Cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around $4.49/bag 'cause it's never on sale. I picked up my order of 6 bags through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon for $13.00, a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store @ $4.49/bag and hard to find usually in this variety! If the sale is right, I highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself!

summary: Delish smoked cheese I will buy over and over again!
review: For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again.

review: i have used the icicle a few times, and it sounds great! everything works how it's supposed to, and it is a very simple but efficient interface. the ONLY thing that i can see that's wrong with it, is it just feels light and cheap. granted its only around $40 so you can't expect too much from it. the plastic just feels rather cheap. but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i don't foresee a major problem on that front.

summary: OK, not that flavorful
review: The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.

summary: Didn't think it would be good...but it is! GREAT!!
review: My daughter has been GF for about 4 years now. We have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour, it usually isn't any good. It is usually grainy. This isn't the case with this product. It makes fantastic pancakes (the rest of the family would eat them). She didn't like the biscuits so we won't make those again.  We used it to make corn dogs and the entire family (and a friend) ate them. No one even noticed. Everyone LOVED them.<br /><br />Amazon has since taken this off of the Subscribe and Save. I am so mad. I hope they put it back on soon.

review: I bought this on a whim and wow do I consider myself lucky.  It was a shot in the dark, but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces I have ever tasted.  Not only has some good spicy heat, but excellent flavor as well.  It's an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet, and a very robust mix of spices.  One thing I really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on, but does not overwhelm it.  The heat is hot for sure, but doesn't linger for very long.  The flavor is very original.  I went back to Amazon and bought a whole case of it.

summary: eat a fig bar instead
review: This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that "yogurt powder" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the "natural flavorings," etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a "vitamin blend" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again.

review: I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did.

summary: Excellent Natural Product for Digestive Well-being!
review: This has been a boon for my digestive system! I take 3 tablets twice daily -- morning (after breakfast) and evening (after dinner). I haven't had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the Hemp Oil capsules! I plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future!<br /><br />BTW, I started taking these capsules because Hemp Oil contains essential Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids in the 3:1 "balanced" ratio, and the capsules don't have the "weird" after-taste that plain Hemp Oil does.

summary: Pop Chips, yum!
review: I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!

summary: Love this cereal!
review: I am now on my third box of this delicious cereal. I try to eat only high fiber cereals, mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling. This is now my favorite! If you purchase the fiber plus bars, many times they have a $1 coupon on the back (off one box of cereal)  I buy mine from Wal Mart @$2.68 and use coupon...great deal. Usually lasts me a week...I eat a bowl everyday.  Also, many times you'll find a $1 coupon on cereal box for fiber bars. They are pretty good too, especially the chocolate almond.

summary: Delicious and high quality
review: We've been using walnut oil for many years; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter, eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It's also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes, and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it.

summary: Great little trees!
review: I ordered two....The Monterey - Double Trunk-Preserved Bonsai Tree &  The Artificial Aralia Bonsai Tree.<br /><br />Both trees came packed so as to not move around in the box.<br />They spray foam around the base and let it cure in the box. It creates a very stable platform.<br />The trees are absoulutely gorgeous!!!!<br />They look very close to the pics they show here.<br />Since they are hand made, each will look slightly different, but nothing that detracts from their overall beauty.<br />By the way, Bonsai-Boy does not manufacture these.<br />They are jobbed out to artisans in other parts of the country, hence the wait of at least 14 days to get your item(s.<br />They are truly works of art and I'd recomend these to anyone who has a love of these trees, but like me, does not have a green thumb.<br />The communicaton with Bonsai-boy is good and they endevor to answer any question you have.<br />Did I mention how beautiful these are? LOL!

review: I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.

summary: Yummy and fizzy!
review: This can of juice was delicious.  It reminded me of the Orangina beverage.  I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with "Energy Drinks" like Red Bull since they market it as "All Natural".  Nevertheless, it's yummy and I recommend it!

summary: Experimental trial and error
review: It took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred.  After that, it is economical and not much trouble.

summary: YUM YUM!
review: I've been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now, and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.

summary: Above average K-cup coffee
review: We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here.

summary: Good, long-lasting flavor, a really good gum!
review: It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Peppermint with Ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in. And man, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review: Not at all happy with the instant coffee taste of my cute little brewer , I began hunting for a solution . The DisposaKups were it !!  My own fresh ground coffee - packed in tight in the DisposaKup - makes a good cuppa joe . Easy to use and no mess . Love them .  Shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion . Thanks

summary: Happy Danes
review: We have two Great Danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them.<br /><br />EVO is the first dog food that both of them enjoys.  I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.<br /><br />I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.

summary: Miracle? No. Fun? Absolutely!
review: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture.

summary: xmas gift
review: I bought this as a gift for Xmas for my best friend, whom loves chocolate  and loves liquor as well. When she opened her gift to find this, she shined the only cheese smile and said " you know me so well". She couldn't wait to try  them. According to her the Jim Beam is the strongest and the Remy Martin least strongest if I'm not mistaken. They are great tasting and the filling is a gel consistence and the chocolate great as well. Only thing i didn't like was the dents on the packaging, noting really to complain about or call the company about cause my best friend loved it either way.These chocolate liquor bottles are a great gift for anyone who loves chocolate and liquor and don't mind them together.

summary: For ginger fans
review: This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said "negligible."<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.

summary: Why is the coffee so expensive at Amazon?
review: I have been using this instant expresso coffee for about a year now.  I buy it in our local supermarket for $3.49 a 2 oz. jar.  I originally needed it for a brownie recipe and looked here to purchase, but I saw the $9.99 price and that certainly made me take a ride to the store.  Luckily, it was on the shelf and at a very reasonable price.  Only one store in the area stocks it.<br /><br />Check your local stores before you buy this online.  Chances are you will find it at a very lesser price locally.  I use it now not just in brownies, but I add two teaspoons to a protein shake, and it makes a great coffee shake.<br /><br />Thank you.

summary: Newman's Own Organics Dog food
review: Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though. I was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and I was paying almost twice as much as on Amazon. Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly.

summary: tasty...but too sweet
review: compared to other egg proteins I have recently used, this one is very sweet.  It is sweetened with splenda, so still very low in actual sugar/carbs.  I prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it, but my wife likes this one b/c its easy to instantize in milk (we use almond milk) with a spoon.  No blender required.

review: These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.

summary: Good flavor, but bad pod quality
review: The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.<br /><br />That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem.

summary: Great Peanuts!
review: Wifey bought these for me for Christmas.  I used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work.  After he left I wanted to try it myself.  These were great. 25 minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done. They taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could.  I might shell some of them and try honey roasting too.  I see a lot of people boil them, what are boiled peanuts like?  You don't see them up here in RI and I've never tried them.

summary: Sweet and delish
review: Last fall I bought a slew of different protein bar brands to see which I liked the most.  Of the many brands I tried, most all were roughly the same in taste, texture, etc.  But these Honey Stingers stood out to me.  They have a much smoother texture, and have a great sweetness to them that really makes them taste great.  I'm a huge fan... gonna by a bunch more boxes for snacks and workouts.

summary: Horrible!
review: So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!

summary: A decent cuppa
review: I'm not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I can't tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isn't subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says "(pack of 3)"; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; it's happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . that's how I buy my coffee most of the time.

review: The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.

summary: Yumm Yumm!
review: I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1/2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth's best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you're set on staying away from BPA, you'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can't make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I'm very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits!

summary: O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple
review: I have been buying ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple regularly for awhile now. I like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient. Also, I have had no problems with delivery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, IPROZON has just lost my business.  I didn't mind paying $15.00 for a case of 12.  I will not, however, pay $39.95 for a case of 12.  That is robbery.  I can walk into Fred Meyer Grocery and buy a case of 12 for $17.88.  Plus there are other sites still selling it for $15.00 per case.  I noticed IPROZON is still selling the other flavors of ONE coconut water for $15.00 for a case of 12.  So what on earth are they thinking.<br /><br />I am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information, but I am willing to do that versus paying nearly $40 for a case of 12.  Quite ridiculous.

review: This is my favorite Progresso soup. The broth has excellent flavor and it's not too salty. Yes the veggies could be a bit firmer, but the pieces are large and tasty. It has some heat already, but I  usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste. If I really want to indulge, I'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating - heaven!

summary: orbit white peppermint is the best!
review: This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.

summary: Not a fan of this blend
review: Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by "that other chain" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.

review: Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink.

summary: I love this snack!
review: I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)

summary: Great well balanced Earl Grey
review: The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.<br />The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.<br />The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).<br />Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.<br />A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.

summary: Great fruit drink
review: I'm diabetic, so I'm always looking for natural, flavorful drinks without a lot of added sugar. Switch fits the bill for me. It's lightly carbonated, much less than a regular soda. The fruit flavor is very natural.<br /><br />The Orange/Tangerine tasted primarily like orange at first. But then I noticed a distinct tangerine aftertaste. The drink actually tasted very much like the tangelos I had the day before! Excellent!<br /><br />The can is also smaller than a regular soda can. That's okay with me, it's fine for a light drink when I'm thirsty. A full can of soda is sometimes a bit too much.<br /><br />Switch will probably become one of my drink alternatives, and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors.

summary: Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others
review: My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like.

summary: Favorite thing about Brazil
review: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

summary: Arrived broken and isn't eligible for return?
review: I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.  I will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isn't in the future.

summary: A winner in the iron category
review: I love the fact that this has so much iron in it.  I'm a vegan and it's not easy to get enought iron.  The molasses isn't quite as tasty as some I've had, but it has about 5 times more iron, so I'm ok with it.  I don't think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food, so I guess it's a winner.

summary: good not great
review: I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product.

summary: I wish my dog liked it
review: Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.

review: I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.

summary: We poured ours out
review: Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's "pure" and then there's "not so much".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.<br />Also used in:<br /><br />  Tyre sealant<br />  Rubber cleaner<br />  De-icer<br />  Stain removers<br />  Fabric softener<br />  Degreaser<br />  Paint<br />  Adhesive<br />  Wallpaper stripper<br /><br />I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded....

summary: Best Hot Sauce and Taco Sauce Available In America
review: This company is an American Classic been in business over 90 years. Why? Because it is the best hot sauce and taco sauce bar none. There are some other good brands oout there, but this is the best and nothing compares to it. The Hot sauce has reasonable heat and bite and adds unique flavor to your favorite Mex foods. The taco (Mild) sauce is milder and just perfect on tacos, enchaladas, tostadas, tamales, Bell Beefers, and frozen mex dinners. The harder to find green sauce is to die for. Great on everything! Unfortunately I don't see the green stuff on Amazon but you can find it. Just get it. Try all three. I grew up with this stuff so am very partial to it. I keep about five or six bottles (each variety) on my shelves at all times. After you try this you will not want to go back to the run of the mill commercial stuff.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GGHZQ">Pico Pica Mexican Hot Sauce 7 oz - HOT</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GGI00">Pico Pica - MILD - Mexican Hot Sauce 7 oz</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084D71ZM">Pico Pica Mexican Hot Sauce 7 oz - HOT(PACK OF 3)</a>

summary: Hands Down, Best Mint EVER.
review: These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You won't regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them!

summary: Great beans!
review: I've never bought vanilla beans before, but I have seen them in the store - all dry and crusty looking.  These beans are vacuum sealed, and because of that are still moist.  They smelled great.  My whole pantry smelled wonderful after I put them in there, and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla-y ice cream I've ever had.  (Even more vanilla-y than Blue Bell!)  When I run out, I'll absolutely buy more of these!

review: Crisp/crunchy and thin- very low in sodium. I usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping. A great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores. Excellent product. The rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet, 0% sodium.

summary: Sugar, lots. Maple, not so much
review: The problem with this peanut butter is the use of "evaporated cane juice" which is a coy way of saying "raw sugar". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the "cane juice" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.

summary: Great product!
review: I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form.

summary: NIce Size, good taste
review: These are good sized seeds, and they taste good, not over roasted.  I know this as I rinse them before I eat them.  The flavor is a little strong for me, which if you knew me would not surprise you.  I'm not the biggest fan on spices that add heat.  If you like Buffalo Wings, I'm sure you'll love these.  It was the "ranch" part of the flavor that caught my eye.

summary: Great product but expensive.
review: The blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys. I was having trouble finding it in the local stores that I shop so I thought I would shop for this online. I was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store. I don't think I will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when I shop locally.

summary: Fizzlicious  and tangy
review: I love this flavor the best for it lightness, but zesty and orange tanginess.  Very refreshing taste and not over powering with no additives; what a plus.  nice carry size, but why should such a good thing be in such a small size.  Good that the product is in a can - recyclable.  there are other similar carbonated-juice out there and this is definitely one that could compete with the low-saturated market.

summary: About the only good thing..
review: Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.<br /><br />I was excited about these, they looked like a "grown up graham cracker".<br /><br />First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.<br /><br />I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.<br /><br />I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I'd have just got a second bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158">Hi I'm Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce</a>.<br />Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste.

summary: the best
review: I got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries.  It rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good.<br /><br />I'm now half way through my second jar of Tone's, which is consistently excellent.  It has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli.  It is way better than raw garlic cloves.  They must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder.  If you have doubts about your current garlic powder, smell it.  If it doesn't have a strong garlic smell, it's just white powder.  Get this Tone's and you'll get your delicious food back.

summary: The Cat likes it, too!
review: I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.<br /><br />I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable.

summary: The best pizza I have ever had!
review: I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas.

review: Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.

review: My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesn't seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{

review: Just ate my first batch and it's as good as any white popcorn I have had. I encountered difficulty obtaining white popcorn from grocery stores and was reduced to eating the horrible yellow type. Luckily I decided to shop this site, and I could not be more pleased. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Next time I will order two four-pound jars plus the Snappy Popcorn White Cheddar Shaker, and get free shipping for a purchase over $25 - which is important because the shipping charges are significant.

summary: Like Fresh Grapefruit Juice, But Better. Lighter, Sweeter, & Refreshingly Fizzy.
review: I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as "100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color). One serving (which is 8 fl.oz.) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs.

summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

summary: Delicious!!
review: I just recently got a Keurig coffee maker & registered it online.  Keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes, get 2 free.  Awhile back, a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that I fell in love with.  So, I decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it.  I brewed my first cup this morning & it smelled VERY strong of coconut so of COURSE I couldn't wait to try it.  After it cooled down a bit I took my first sip.  AMAZING!!  It is quite delightful & I STRONGLY recommend it if you like coconut coffee.  No bitter aftertaste, either & no soot @ the bottom of my cup.  Awesome

summary: Choco Drops
review: A superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor. These drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched. My dogs just love them.  My grandchildren ate few thinking they were "Hershey kisses"!! The children's mother who is a Pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs!! The  product is excellent,service from the Amazon supplier was excellent but I wish they (any supplier) would not use UPS as a shipper. UPS is slower than "Snail Mail"!!

summary: Better than the real stuff
review: This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.

summary: My New Favorite Popcorn
review: This popcorn pops up light, fluffy, and crunchy.  I have been using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn, but this is slightly less expensive and very tasty and fresh.  My popcorn method is as follows:<br />Use a Westbend Stir Crazy 6 Qt. popper.  It is the best because it gets hot quickly without smoking or burning the corn.<br />Then use 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, Flavacol to taste (I use about a teaspoon).  Put the oil and Flavacol in the popper and plug it in.  Add approximately 3/4 cup of Snappy White Popcorn.  When the popping stops enjoy a large batch of great popcorn with very little fat, and what fat there is will be monosaturated.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8LT10">Gold Medal Prod. 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt 35oz.</a>

These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!

summary: So bad I had trouble giving it away!
review: I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?

summary: 41 cents per 0.8 ounce is more than twice the regular price
review: I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.<br /><br />$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.<br /><br />On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks.

summary: A poor choice
review: Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says "Not a significant source of protein."  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.

summary: Really nice - sweet but with a bit of a kick
review: The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

summary: Good Instant
review: This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.

summary: Glorified baby food
review: I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, "Why you gave me baby food, mom?" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested.

review: at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !

summary: Delicious Decaffeinated
review: First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.<br /><br />While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain "different" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: "it really is delicious for a decaf."<br /><br />The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.<br /><br />The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this.

summary: Addictive
review: These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

summary: Good, not Great
review: I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good, it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay, I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it, you may like it.

summary: Favorite K-Cup
review: Of all the K-Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button. I like other coffee selections too, but this one really stands out.<br /><br />I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40-.50 a cup, there is no waste, no pot cleanup, and, best of all, great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.<br /><br />I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K-Cups, but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs

summary: One of the best for Puck k-cups.
review: This is my favorite so far amongst the Wolfgang Puck K-Cups. The word that comes to mind when i sip it is "Bright". It has a natural sweetness and good flavor, without being overly heavy. The packaging lists it as a Medium Roast, but i'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum. It's a very enjoyable cup, and i'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with Green Mountian's popular Vermont Country Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />I generally haven't been impressed with the Wolfgang Puck flavored varieties (Vanilla Francaie, Jamaica me Crazy), but this regular cup is quite good.

summary: Excellent price, extremely fresh
review: I bought these vanilla beans about a month ago to make homemade vanilla extract and also to have on hand since I always seem to have some culinary use for vanilla beans. I was very impressed with the quality. The dried up store bought vanilla beans cannot compare to these. Will be ordering more soon!

summary: Excellent store bought cookie
review: I bake, so I'm rarely impressed by store bought cookies. This one, though....divine.  So divine. I don't like heavy chocolate, or dark chocolate, but I like a little chocolate. This cookie is the right amount pastry, raspberry and chocolate, and it's light, like a Madeleine.

summary: Healthy and versatile
review: There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real.  But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed<br />- good source of fibre & potassium & calcium<br />- 3x the iron than spinach<br />- low in cholesterol & sodium<br />- doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects<br /><br />***Uses & Taste***<br />Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.<br /><br />Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a breakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.<br /><br />One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)<br /><br />***This brand***<br />I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy.<br /><br />Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes!  Bye bye poppy seeds!

summary: Only a 'HINT" of vanilla
review: This is a dark, smooth brew (darker than Timothy's French Vanilla), But as with Timothy's it has only a slight hint of vanilla. This is my third "taste test" searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee.  Gloria Jean's was undrinkable.  Timothy's was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this. If it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite.

summary: Really different - Really good
review: What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple.

summary: Diappointed
review: Cat grass is cat grass, and I have one cat that absolutely loves it; another that couldn't care less.  It's winter now, so I couldn't find it where I buy seeds, so I went on line.  Product is okay, service was prompt.  My disappointment: could only order one two-ounce package per shipping and handling fee.  Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee!

summary: Great strong flavor
review: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

review: I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it.

summary: Solid Medium Roast Coffee with Just a Hint of Bold. Good Flavor. Not Acidic.
review: Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor.  Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.<br /><br />Vienna Coffee House has less of a kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFL1Q">Wolfgang Puck French Roast (Dark Roast), 24-Count K-cups (Pack of 2)</a>), but a little more than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />Good flavor, slightly sweet with a good bean taste that isn't tough on your stomach.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: please revise your coffee descriptions - they are terrible and give the consumer no information on the flavor/style of coffee featured.  If you want us to buy the coffee, be forthright on your descriptions.

summary: Had much higher hopes!
review: I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.

summary: great snack but strong flavor
review: i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice! i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the USA...these are great since there is no juice! you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess. i have been super happy with these. the flavor is pretty bold so I only eat 1-2 packs a week. I am going to try another flavor. i definitely recommend trying them! i love olives and this is a great idea

summary: If there were no other coffee in the house
review: ...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck.

summary: Really great taste! Price should be less though.
review: This soup is incredibly good!  But honestly, I was looking for a better deal through Amazon. The free shipping is great, but it's over 3 bucks a can, and I can get it cheaper through my grocery store. They are always having WP sales for 2 bucks a can, 2.50 a can... so does anyone know about a better deal than this? It's a really good tasting soup!

summary: Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!
review: The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.

review: I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts.

summary: Wow, it's worth the cost for tender white hulless
review: I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find. If you are appalled by the shipping cost, like I was, try looking elsewhere for a better deal. For instance, one popular site offers 6 lbs for $11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments (which you can cancel any time). Try www.c**king.com.

review: I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast.

review: I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good, it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay, I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it, you may like it.

summary: Most excellent sardines!
review: Just had my 1st can of these sardines and I am delighted!  Big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor.  Made a tuna salad...but used sardines.  Wonderful!  I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.  I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and I read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function.  I'll be ordering more of these!

summary: Not as flavorful as I imagined
review: I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap.

summary: Mrs Mays Anonymous
review: There ought to be a recovery program. But the good side is that a Mrs. Mays addiction is healthy. I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).<br /><br />Almonds have always been my staff of life -- raw, roasted, dry roasted, blanched, flavored, and of course Mrs Mays. I rarely have a day without them. I even feed them to the parrot. A bird guy told me they were the healthiest. And the bird goes nuts for Mrs. Mays.<br /><br />These are, dare I say, miracle nuts. One taste and I was hooked. How she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle. If you're tired of tastless, bland, gotta-eat-it-because-its-healthy snacks from the nutrition store, try these for a pleasant awakening.<br /><br />Mike

summary: This Ice Cream Club ROCKS!!!
review: Recently, I was gifted the Ice Cream of the Month Club by a very good friend. I was somewhat confused thinking "how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club?" But, with having given and received numerous "of the month clubs" and having all great experiences in the past, I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the "Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato." After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having "velvet wrapping around your body." The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!

summary: NICE FRUITY FLAVOR!
review: Hibiscus Tea 24 Bags, I've got this tea for my Dad to help him with his Blood Pressure, it is a little early to tell. I also taking it myself, I like all kinds of Tea, Green, Triple Leaf Tea, this one has a very deep purple color and nice Fruity Flavor, I really like it. Hibiscus Tea is the combination of two herbs. Hibiscus is cultivated throughout the tropics, its flowers are highly prized for making Jams, Jellies, sauces and Beverages<br /><br />Lemongrass is a sub-tropical herb known for its strong citrus flavor and aroma. It became a popular edition to Tea blends in the 1970s and was quickly accepted in Europe. By blending these tropical flavours together, they have created a tart and fruity Tea that is Kid friendly and truly wonderful hot or cold. I also like the fact that this Tea does not contain any Caffeine, that usually keeps me up, no problem with Hibiscus Tea. It tastes Great! Thank You

summary: Tasted pretty much like Orange soda.
review: For a beverage that is basically 100% fruit juice that has been carbonated, with no sweetners or preservatives added, Switch Orange Tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.<br /><br />That isn't a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.<br /><br />(On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange "flavored"...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.)

review: I ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test (to go along with the theme "Fortunately we know our math facts").  The majority of the cookies arrived still in tact.  I understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies.  I am very please with the product and the customer service.  I will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure I refer my family and friends to this business.

review: I'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip-off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case.

review: You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive "CERTIFIED" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware.

review: This is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of "old" green tea. Stay away from the big brands like Lipton, Twinnings, and Bigelow. They do well with black tea but not green.<br /><br />For green tea go with this, Uncle Lee's, or Tazo. You'll never be able to go back to the others, which will taste like swill from a polluted river.<br /><br />This is real green tea. And it's not expensive. Recommended.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rusk Reeder

review: I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.

summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review: Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much.<br />...(cough)<br />So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they'd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!<br />Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly/gummy, but don't expect much.

summary: Kinetic Kraziness!
review: This coffee (er, koffee) is superb!  I am lucky enough to live where this is roasted.  I can get my Kinetic fix at the local grocery stores.  You can taste the care put into this flavorful espresso.  Living in a small town, I happen to know the roasters.  You would be hard pressed to find better people.  They are active participants of the "Great Arcata to Ferndale World Championship Cross-Country Kinetic Sculpture" race.  If you haven't heard of it, look it up.  We are a strange people, here in Arcata.

summary: Not NEARLY as strong as claimed!
review: In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(

review: I have tried several decaf K-cubs and have found this to be the best.

I will be ordering it again and again!

summary: Sweet Coconut Flavor with A Mild Aftertaste.  Mild to Medium Blend.
review: Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size.

summary: Delicious chips
review: Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.

summary: Serve On the Rocks
review: I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the "The Switch Orange Tangerine" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about "The Switch"... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with "No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can't see myself drinking "The Switch" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend "The Swtich". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.

summary: Just Right and you will love it!
review: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

summary: Great Cat Grass Seeds!
review: I wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house. I planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil. I had a large bunch of grass in about a week. My cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen.

summary: What Is This "Stuff?"
review: Bits of "Clam?" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! It's awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this!

review: I love this water! I started buying it after my Bikram yoga classes to rehydrate, and now drink it whenever I feel a little dehydrated.  Living in AZ, I tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  Try them! You'll be hooked :)

summary: Best chocolate drink ever
review: This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate, don't miss this.

review: My plant arrived quickly and packaged very well. Almost too well cause I was so anxious to see it and it took a bit of time to unwrap it:) The first day it didn't want to eat because of the stress from shipping, but now it's eating the bugs I give it. Everybody is so intriuged with it and we all love it!!

summary: new recipe gone bad
review: I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.

summary: Questionable "healthy" drink...
review: Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common "fruit" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of "fructose" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of "pretend" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.

summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

summary: Consistently Delicious
review: Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18 - $0.40 / oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />With the "Subscribe & Save" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping. Previously, I had subscribed to the 33 oz cans - right up until the option was discontinued by Amazon. I have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly.

review: I'd never tried chia seeds before, but I'm trying to be more health-conscious, so I ordered this with the intent to put them in my overnight oatmeal. They're great! A little goes a long, long way. I had no problems with bloating, they taste like nothing, and they pack a nutritional wallop. I've since added them to quinoa and couscous, and have a bread recipe I'm planning to try. Great value. I'll buy them again.

summary: It's alright.
review: I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.

review: I love these so much I'd give them a 10-star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry's but they're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.<br /><br />I eat them as a bread substitute with everything!  Can't go wrong with the calories and they don't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ...

summary: Sweet beef
review: Beef sticks and honey - what a great combination! The Ole Smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. Adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. The Honey Stung Ole' Smokies are always a favorite with our friends; the saddlebag pack is a perfect take-along to football parties.

summary: Not what I thought
review: As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />"Stacey"'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by-product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold-out" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. "

summary: NOT 144 PACKETS!!  ONLY 12!!!!
review: I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them.

summary: Tastes processed
review: I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. It's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that I haven't opened yet if I can do that...

summary: Perfect for Cockers!
review: My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!

review: This has been a boon for my digestive system! I take 3 tablets twice daily -- morning (after breakfast) and evening (after dinner). I haven't had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the Hemp Oil capsules! I plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future!<br /><br />BTW, I started taking these capsules because Hemp Oil contains essential Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids in the 3:1 "balanced" ratio, and the capsules don't have the "weird" after-taste that plain Hemp Oil does.

summary: Above average K-cup coffee
review: We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here.

summary: My daughter's favorite jarred food
review: My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!

summary: GF Bisquick never disappoints
review: I made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend, remade a family favorite from years ago, Chicken and Dumplings, which was on the Betty Crocker Website under GF.  We couldn't tell the difference between the GF and regular mix in the dumpling results.  I made the recipe from scratch for six, using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth, baby carrots, celery, cut green beans, onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving.  Husbie loved it.

summary: Paul Newman saved my dog!
review: Prior to switching to Newman's Own Organics Dog food, my 4 year old shih-tzu was crunching on Iams. Which was fine, except that every 2-3 months or so he'd have stomach problems. After switching, his poops have been firmer, no stomach issues in sight, AND his coat has gotten glossier (and much less flaky). Duncan likes his new food and so do I!

summary: THE DRINK OF CHOICE FROM HELL
review: This superb tasting drink was used at the turn of the century for medicinal purposes as it purportedly had calming , but hallucinogenic effects. Thought to have same effects as THC but was disproved in 1999. But still , it is a very popular drink if mixed properly . Which is dissolving sugar through an absinthe spoon and mixing with vodka . Aptly named TNT. The drink was somewhat popularized by the character Inspector Frederick Abberline, played by Johnny Depp in the movie FROM HELL based upon Jack The Ripper.

summary: Good on Everything
review: I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)<br /><br />We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream.

summary: HAPPY Healthy Dog's
review: I first purchased this food at the Pomona Pet Expo this year and as I do all my cooking for my animals I was looking for a natural grain free dry to add to their wet.  I learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible.<br /><br />This by far is one of the best Natural foods I have purchased and my dogs just (Love) it..  The Holistic Primitive is high in Protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs.  This food has never been recalled and is made in it's own plant, unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names.  The price I find to be fare, as I have paid much higher for other Holistic food which was not received well by my dogs.<br /><br />I highly recommend Earthborn Natural food for anyone who really knows the importance of feeding your "companions" healthy food and for those who really Love their Pet's..

summary: Slurp
review: I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory.

summary: Sorry Wolfgang!
review: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

summary: Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff
review: As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">Black Cherry</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.

summary: Pricey yet surprisingly refreshing!
review: I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a "cheap drinker" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96� per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12� per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6� per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8� per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.

summary: Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful
review: This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something "strawberry" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively "healthy" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.

summary: Good Fruity Gum
review: This is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum. It's sweet, and doesn't have a strong aspartame taste, for being sugar-free. It doesn't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'Forever Fruit' name would lead you to believe, but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums, and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in. Everyone in my family likes this flavor of Stride.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with the darker-but-similar-colored-packaging 'Mandarin' flavor.

summary: A favorite quick meal solution
review: When we get very busy in our home, I like this sausage a lot for quick meal options. The flavor is a bit sweet, and works well with lots of types of vegetables. Usually I'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done, then add sweet potatoes,potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet. With a bit of cheese on top it's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys. Mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for. For that I cut the sausage into coins and cook it up, then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual, add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking. The sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it's just so easy to make.

summary: One of the Best Decaffeninated Coffees I've Tasted
review: I am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively.<br /><br />On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: "Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting."<br /><br />More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.<br /><br />Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.<br /><br />Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing.<br /><br />I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.<br /><br />This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am!

summary: Best Cat Food
review: I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his "spunk" so I decided it was time to start buying him "real" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!

review: I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food.

summary: Like tiny light flavored peanut halves....
review: Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat.

summary: sassafrass tea
review: I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or "bark" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.

summary: I love these things!!
review: I have never enjoyed my Keureg more!  They couldn't be easier to use and I'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications.  Love these things!!<br /><br />Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage, etc... one trick I have come to rely on is NOT to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee.  You need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid isn't touching the coffee inside (maybe a little less than 1/2cm from the top rim).  When I follow this protocol, I get a perfect cup every time.  When I fill it too high, I end up with leakage.  The only problem is that I usually need a cup of coffee int he morning before I can follow my own instructions.

summary: Not as rich and satisfying as I thought
review: Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.<br /><br />That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!

summary: Now that's orange
review: This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.

summary: Excellent!
review: This jerky reminds me a little of the artisan jerky I used to be able to find in California. The strips are thin, so they're easy to bite and the flavor is slightly spicy and definitely smokey.<br /><br />My husband absolutely loved it..he's been taking 2-3 pieces per day in his lunch and they never come back home with him the way other snacks sometimes do! I'm buying more while they're on sale!

summary: Good quality - not 'getting' whatever flavor difference...
review: I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work.

summary: Very DISAPPOINTING Pancakes
review: I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.

summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

summary: Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!
review: I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except "sweets," of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy

summary: Great deal on great tea
review: My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some "loose" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh.

summary: Same Great Taste, just More of it!
review: Bigger is always better, and that is not what she said, I did.  I got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it.  I found that Vita Coco, is the best brand around.  The pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing, thirst quenching beverage.  I have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so I don't cramp up in my hands. plus with all the nutrients and benefits, whats there not too like. With subscribe and save,  I can quench my thirst any time of year.  Thanks vita coco, you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts!!!

summary: Convenient and tasty too!
review: Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!

summary: Five star
review: I've found this product (Bob's Red Mill Bicarbonate of Soda or Soda Bicarb without Aluminum) to be just as I'd hoped.  I use it in a 3 to 1 (Pure Maple Syrup to Bob's Soda Bicarb) ration, respectively, as an anti-cancer holistic therapy approach to a recent rise in my (16 year) post-op PSA.  I don't have the results yet, as I'm only in my third week of use.  My next PSA lab test will tell the story.  (These tests should be conducted by the same laboratory, as differing labs employ different reagents and the results may vary to some degree.)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041CKRJC">Bob'Red Mill Aluminum-Free Baking Soda - 16 oz Bundle of 4</a><br /><br />This product is mixed with the maple syrup, heated and stirred in a LARGE pot (when mixed, the two react and create an initial rapidly expanding and foaming mixture which soon 'settles down') for five minutes, not to exceed 120 degrees farenheit.  The mixture will not remain as a homogeneous mixture; it will separate and must be stirred with each use.*  The goal is to raise one's systemic pH to above 7.  I've been keeping mine at 8 to 9.  Avoid use of sugar, white bread, meat and alcohol during therapy.  One may check several testimonials on the internet by searching for "Maple Syrup Soda Bicarb therapy".  My height is 5' 10; weight 164 lbs.  I average 2 1/2 tablespoons of this mixture morning and evening (before breakfast and after dinner).<br />  *Best to use a funnel and pour the heated/stirred mixture into a clean plastic milk bottle.  This makes re-mixing by shaking easier.<br /><br />I measure my pH at least twice daily, prior to taking each dose, using the Urine test strips purchased through Amazon made by Phinex**.  These strips will also measure one's pH by testing saliva.  (Probably more accurate at the moment tested - as the urine may have accumulated over a period of hours; a combination of high pH and, possibly a current acetic pH level.  The goal is to maintain an alkaline pH level.<br /><br />**See: [...]<br /><br />The author is NOT a member of the medical profession.

summary: Best For Making Kefir
review: I make Coconut Water Kefir with O.N.E. 100% Coconut Water.  I've tried using Zico brand.  I do not like to discredit any brand, but for some reason my coconut water kefir goes bad much too quickly when using Zico (sometimes within 1-2 days - should last 7 days).  I do not presume to know why.  The taste of Zico is not as good as O.N.E.  Maybe they overheat/process it?  O.N.E.'s package says it is "gently pasteurized."<br /><br />If you'd like more information on why Coconut Water Kefir is so great for you go to [...](No, I am not connected with Body Ecology.)<br /><br />If you'd like to learn how to make Coconut Water Kefir go to [..]<br /><br />There's also milk (cow's and goat's) kefir that are extremely good for you.  Kefirs are used all over the world for health and nutrition -- just not common in America ... go figure.

review: I love the taste of real garlic - not the granulated or brined stuff. These are great flavoring agents, especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs. Love the choice between roasted and raw, and a little goes a long way. I first bought this product 2 years ago. Despite using one or the other at least once a week, I am only now needing to replace them.<br />Yum!

review: I'm a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw/freezdried raw  home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years. These treats take the cake and run. OMG all cats/ clients cats love these treats. They are the onlything i will ever use for training again. Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.<br /><br />If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.

summary: Sorry Wolfgang!
review: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

review: The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.

summary: coconut in the morning?
review: I did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as I got it in a variety pack. I put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no I don't like sweet in the AM. But its not sweet, I am quite surprised at the flavor and how I like it. Would I like it every morning..NO but it was a nice change. Made me feel I was waking up in a Jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music, well maybe not but it was close

summary: Hodgson mill brownie mix
review: Good, but I add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp. of baking powder along with a couple of TBSP. of Cocoa powder because I like brownies a little higher and more cake like.  They come yummy and with the added flour, they're not too sweet.

summary: Good stuff!!!!!
review: My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!

summary: Nice tasting drink
review: I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!

review: My 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods, and I was looking for a treat to give him when he visits. He loves these candies, and I don't feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one. They stay at Grandma's and Grandpa's house! (Of course we brush his teeth afterwards.)

summary: I will never go back to Senseo pods as long as these are available.
review: First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods.

review: We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic "replicators", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station.

They taste fantastic,the price is reasonable and you can at least have<br />something that before these sardines was not available to people<br />on a low salt diet. Side benefits as they are skinless and boneless.<br />Thanks to the Roand Co.

summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

summary: Taste good to me
review: I'm not a coffee snob, so I'm not picky about what kind of coffee I purchase. I chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WO0">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Hand-Roasted Hazelnut Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> as my first ground coffee, and I have to say, Community Coffee smells and tastes better than Coffee Bean's! This is totally personal preference though.<br /><br />This Community Coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good.

review: I started using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EMA3AS">Lourdes Gourmet Chimichurri Sauce</a> on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it.  Now I'm putting it on my chicken, vegetables & pasta.  I'm turning into a real chimichurri addict.

summary: Non-Flavored coffee drinkers beware!
review: I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.

summary: 'm'azing mBerry's! Definitely works and is a ton of fun!
review: I really enjoyed this, tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was flabbergasted! The look on his face was priceless. Best for groups of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the merrier! Wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by. People said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent 15 minutes or more. Obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out. Just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it!

summary: Good jerky
review: As processed, mass produced jerkies go, this is one of the best I've had. It compares with King-B. I don't care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing, but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct.<br />Fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it.

summary: Surprisingly delicious
review: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

summary: Okay for a casual get together
review: I keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests drop-in, or if one of the staff has guests.  What we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf, but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times.  Having just said that, I realize that I must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on hand.<br /><br />I may have given these Kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe, but I have a problem with  the size.  First off, these cuts are only one inch thick, which is ghastly offensive.  I steak should be, at the bare minimum, two inches thick.  I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these "people" committ against decent food.  Can't these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.  Please don't get me started, for I wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food, particularly the bargain menu, but that is merely a hope and dream for another day.<br /><br />Secondly, isn't there a law somewhere about a steak less that  two pounds?  My heavens, this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler, a tease.  I suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliff.<br /><br />Lastly, I must close this review before I become too distraught.

review: This is definitely a "Girl's Alcoholic Slushy."  There are 6 different flavors, and you can use any wine you choose. The package directions are for an entire blender of slush. I have found that using a Tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person.  Good stuff.  Have not found anyone who does not like this product.

review: I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.

summary: Good food, good price
review: We purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane. The dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach, so this food is perfect for them. All three dogs love it (even the picky one) and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we've tried (I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am about THAT). I did a lot of research to find a quality food that isn't full of filler and won't break the bank. I am 100% pleased with this food, more so than any of the other more expensive brands that I've tried.

summary: Perfect Cocoa
review: Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it.

summary: If you like gummy white bread . . . .
review: White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me.

summary: Senseo Coffee Pods
review: Coffee pods used to be sold in Safeway and Target etc. stores in my area. In the last year the pods have not been stocked in favor of the new single brewer style K-Cup. While I can locate many sources on the internet I have found that quickest delivery at a reasonable price is buying Senseo from Amazon.<br />Mostly a French Vanilla drinker I find the taste is consistant, the packages keep fresh for months, (I typically buy 72 pods per order). The pods work very well in my Bunn 35400.0003 Coffee Maker Tea Brewer Single Serve Pourover. I wish every item I purchased was as easy reliable and quick as these coffee pods.

summary: Great spicy flavor
review: I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.

summary: first rate dog food
review: Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs.

summary: My favorite tea
review: I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.

summary: I like it but the cost
review: I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.

The cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free.  It's still good baking soda though, and kudos to the Bob's Red Mill marketing department.  You guys are geniuses.

summary: definately worth it
review: I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors, and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I've bought. The coffee lost it's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old, dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn't sure what was the problem, cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness, texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.<br /><br />I've tried different regional coffees including, papa new guinea, Kenya AA, Sumatra beans, Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it's being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that's what happened to one of the bags. As you know, coffee and oxygen don't go well together, cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste.<br /><br />I've made a recent purchase again and I'm very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves.

I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far.

summary: They make the best baby food.
review: My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.

summary: OK, but very very earthy tasting.
review: This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I don't mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting.

summary: A Godsend for gluten intolerant people!
review: I find it hard to express how pleased I was to find Bisquick in a gluten free form.  I have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice, and potato flour and none of them tasted good.  The Bisquick bisquits are delicious, but unfortunatly I couldn't make satisfactory dumplings with the mix.

summary: One of the best salsas!!
review: Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really can't go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37.

summary: Hickory Smoked Way Too Salty!
review: Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.

summary: Favorite thing about Brazil
review: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

review: Very high quality dulce de leche from Argentina. Compared to most brands, it's a bit lighter colored, and the taste is more subdued and milkier. You may or may not appreciate this, as it's not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche, but it's by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make. For this, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

summary: Too sweet to drink uncut.
review: Now, we're not big juice drinkers in this family.  We take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet.  This is the same.  It's nicely carbonated, and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste, but it's still too sickly sweet.  Cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you'll be happy.

summary: Very DISAPPOINTING Pancakes
review: I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.

summary: Great for a hot Mocha Latte!
review: I use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte.  It's terrific!  I ordered on the auto ship plan through Amazon and save about a $1.50 per can over buying it locally.  Plus I get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it!  Great product and great service.

summary: Soothing; Subtly Fruity; Unique; Good balance.
review: I found this tea when I explored a local grocery store on the north shore of Oahu on a trip to Hawaii last summer. Every now & then I like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasn't totally bizarre. (How you'd guess I'm American?) I enjoy white, black, flavored & herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, non-dairy creamer, rosehip extract & refined sugar. I've never considered putting non-dairy creamer into tea. Would it be a mess I dumped into the mug & stirred to death? Instead, I found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil-like moisture proof package.<br /><br />After steeping ~3mins, I was thrilled to discover a light-flavored cup of tea, slightly fruity-scented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. And no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />A year later I found one of the packages in my luggage & found it just as tasty & easy to prepare as last year. I went online to buy some more & was thrilled to find that Amazon offered the same item & a couple of other flavors by the same company too!

summary: Still the best coffee!
review: We were looking for a smooth, rich, non-acidic, non-bitter coffee when we came upon Amazon's reviews for Yuban coffee.  Well, we've been buying Yuban Original Roast Ground Coffee from Amazon for about a year now, and folks, what can we say, it's still the best tasting coffee around.  Coupled with our marvelous Bunn coffee maker (also an Amazon purchase) which makes a fresh, hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes, it just doesn't get any better than this.<br />Keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is (it fluctuates up and down quite a bit) and when you can catch it at a great deal, buy some.  You won't be disappointed.

summary: Best stevia product I ever used
review: I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.

summary: Awesome Good ol Green Tea
review: I got this for my mom and she loved it. She just got a tea maker and with this 3 pack of 8 discs each, she is going to have a lot of tea. I shouldn't have gotton the awake tea for her because it was only 1 package with 7 discs because it is more expensive. Oh well, the thought that counts! Btw if you read this, please check out my seller profile and items i sell. I will star to sell stuff soon and once i talk with amazon i will let everyone choose super saver shipping. I am a true seller and give the customers what they wan't in perfect condition. Anyways, this tea is great and i reccomend this to everyone who loves tea.

summary: Great Chipotle Taste
review: We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.

summary: Not for me...
review: I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper.

summary: Tastes like a diet product
review: I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting.

summary: Good - with amended cooking directions!
review: If you follow the cooking directions, in my opinion, you have wallpaper paste.  Cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, and it is much better - a little chewy, but that's how I like it!  Breakfast takes more planning now, since it's a longer cooking time than my old brand - but good taste and worth it.

summary: Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good
review: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.

summary: Nice rich flavor, good cup of coffee
review: We've only been using the k-cups about 2 months.  Both my wife and I like our coffee bold.  I've been guided by amazon reviews and started out with Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Although that is still my favorite, I got this French Roast on a Friday sale and would say that it's my new second choice.  I have also tried Coffee People's Black Tiger (a close third) and Kona (not a fan).  This is a nice, well-rounded every-day cup, more on the bold side but not wincingly so.

summary: Smooth and Slightly Sparkly
review: The grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on Tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching TV.<br /><br />Once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water, you may want to order this by the case.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavorings or colorings, not to mention extra sugar. The only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate. Lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate, smooth, slightly tingly and delicious drink.<br /><br />Perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

summary: Some cans tastes good, others horrid
review: I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks!

summary: Too strong of flavors
review: I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.

review: This is very good dog treat. Our Chihauhua loves them. It is her favorite. They are semisoft,so the older dogs with few teeth can enjoy them.

summary: Great product!
review: My three-year-old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant.  This is a great product. Easy to carry (because it's a powder) and mix it when you need it.  And, this is an awesome price. $10.00 less than I usually pay for three cans.

summary: Convenience at low cost
review: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

summary: Yummy!
review: They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.<br />I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.

summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

review: I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!

summary: Big Disappointment
review: I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!

review: This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.

summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

review: This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity.

summary: Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general
review: The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.

review: It's all natural, no artificial color, no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.

summary: Not exactly what I thought I was getting.
review: Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix is very, very good.  However, know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix.  You are getting individual (or for two people) servings of pancake and waffle mix.  This formula is different than that for the larger packages of Baking and Pancake Mix and does not make biscuits, muffins, or other short breads very well, too sweet for my taste.  If you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles, then get the larger packages.

summary: a little surprised
review: I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Belly's are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesn't seem overly hygienic. Since I didn't open the box for a few months the Jelly Belly's were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded

summary: Love It!
review: In spite of this product being named "Cajun Style," please don't worry about it being too "hot."  It has just the right amount of flavor; not too overpowering and not too bland.  I fried some whiting with it and a family friend said it was the best fish he ever tasted.<br /><br />A suggestion for those who like really crispy fish is to combine the product with corn meal before frying.  I use a 50/50 ratio.<br /><br />Buying it this way from Amazon is a money-saver because of the free shipping and Amazon's great price.  I saved about $1.25 a box (compared to buying it from the supermarket).  Also, having it shipped to me is much more convenient.<br /><br />I fully recommend Golden Dipt Cajun Fish Fry Mix.  I believe you'll be pleased buying it from Amazon.

summary: Cereal is great.  Price is awful.
review: I really like the Mueslix cereal, but the Amazon price is awful.<br />$22.73 for a 5 pack is over $4.50 a box.<br />This product RETAILS in the stores here for around $4 a box (Publix, Kroger, Ingles).<br />So the Amazon price is higher than retail.<br /><br />Mueslix is almost never on sale though, unlike other Kellogg's cereals.<br />1-2 times per year, Publix grocery has all Kellogg's cereals for half price.<br />$2/box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks.<br /><br />I expected the Amazon price to be more like $3/box, since it was a 5 pack.<br />But boy was I wrong.

summary: Cocoa wasn't bad. . .Price was horrible
review: The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(

summary: Can't find the perfect Creme' Br�l&eacute;e Coffee!
review: 10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.

summary: Stephens Hot Hazelnut Hot Chocolate
review: This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.) It tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix.  It's difficult to find, so locating it on Amazon was a great find.

I enjoy the flavor of coffee!<br /><br />These vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use. It keeps the coffee fresh!!  I use then to refill another container and it works well for me!!

summary: Great coffee, problematic k-cups!
review: I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled.

review: Oh My - these are going on my list to re-order! They are absoultely DELCIOUS! Actually like them a lot better than the Oreos with cream in the middle. Crispy, crunchy, low cal cookie (if you can eat only 1 bag, that is). Packs a powerful chocolate punch - for a low cal snack. Satisfies my chocolate craving without the guilt. [Actually choose these over the Lorna Doone thins any day - more flavorful & satisfying]. Have to stop myself from ripping open a 2nd pkg.

summary: Nice for a late night cup
review: My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1/2" thick!<br /><br />So you're not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ain't half bad.

summary: Too much mint
review: I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka "herbal infusion") and in my opinion, mint and "tropical" don't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea.

review: Granda Po's are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious.  They are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt-free.  I love all the flavors.  My son begs me for them, so now he's a fan too.  I even shipped them to my brother's platoon in Iraq.  Everyone loved them!

summary: Godly King B beef jerky strips are back.
review: I used to eat these King B beef jerky sticks all the time when I was younger, they were my favorite! I figured once King B was gone so was my beloved jerky, but luckily Jack Links has brought it back. This jerky is above and beyond any of that overly-sweet bagged jerky Jack links sells. No, instead this is the way jerky should be, nice and chewy and salty yum. I know some people on here complained about the saltiness but I don't think they're overly salty, they're just plain delicious. Order some, you won't regret it.

summary: Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general
review: The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.

summary: Light Coconut Flavored Coffee.
review: I am usually a non flavored coffee drinker, but I do like to mix things up every now and again. This is a lightly coconut flavored coffee. The coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical undertones of the coconut. It is a nice summer drink.

summary: there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies
review: My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.

summary: I HATE coconut BUT
review: This was not bad at all. I had a bad experience with VitaCoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible!!! It had that strong coconut flavor that I do not like. I had already bought this so I was nervous to try it. I was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut. It doesn't have that typical strong coconut taste. I usually stay away from anything coconut. Candy, food, beverages, etc. For some reason it gets me sick. But I wanted to try this, because I heard coconut water is good for you. I already tried the mango, pineapple, and pink guava flavors. They are delicious. Pink guava is my favorite. O.N.E. brand is my favorite. As long as I don't really taste that strong coconut flavor, then I will keep drinking this.

summary: Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!
review: Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample.

review: My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends.  I had three soy sauces to choose from.  After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass!  Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness.  We were splashing right on every piece, rather that dunking/dipping. Friends wanted to know where I found it. I'm going back to order more right now, and I'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that's affordable and unique; instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it's boring.

Since then, I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again.

summary: Incredible!! Fantastic!
review: I received a jar of this Instant Espresso as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I was quite "insulted" at first, as I've never used instant coffee of any kind and couldn't figure out why she gave it to me! Then this past weekend, I was out of coffee beans & this was all I had (must have coffee in morning).  So I made it, & WOW, it was awesome!! In fact, I'm drinking a mug of it right now as I right this review! I LOVE IT!!  However, I make it in more of a latte fashion.  I've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte.  I'll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores, and if I can't find it, I'll be getting it here on Amazon. Definitely a great buy!!

summary: Sucralose!
review: I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was "diet" or "low calorie".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.

review: I bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life. On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!

summary: Almost as good as homemade
review: We used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide Argentine, but alas, said pipeline moved away.  This is the next best thing and doesn't involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes.

summary: Miracle berry + lemons = AWESOMENESS
review: I was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal, so I decided to give these tablets a try. The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods/beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining.

summary: Good Hot Chocolate
review: I love these hot chocolates. I think they're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks, and I never used to drink much hot chocolate.<br />I recommend these

summary: Great boost!
review: I love this stuff!  I sit in front of a computer all day at work, it's easy to get tired, not to mention I've always had trouble sleeping, so I never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep, more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night.  I was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but I certainly didn't feel the shakes or jittery at all.  I felt more awake, and I didn't crash from it later.  It wears off gradually after a few hours but it helps to get through the main part of the day.  I don't use it every day but on occassion when I need a boost.

summary: Not Safe!
review: After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

summary: Gluten-free bliss!
review: Wow--this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product "licorice," but they are merely rip-offs of "Dots" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for "real" licorice.

review: This was our first time trying Popchips, but I had heard so many good things about them so I was eager to try them.  We ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors.

summary: Decent canned clam chowder
review: I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.

summary: Great Product! This is REAL Garlic Juice!
review: I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!

summary: Real Food for Cats
review: This cat food has great, healthy ingredients.  Cats shouldn't eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet.  (Think: Mice, Rodents, Moles, Grasses, Rabbits, Bird, etc)  I switched my cat from Iam's canned food to this one, thinking that I would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it.  However, she ate it immediately! I was so happy!  As another reviewer said, there are whole peas in this stuff.  It looks a little gross, but my cat eats it. However, I must admit that she will eat just about anything.  Her favorite treats are sproated oat grass, spinach and broccoli stalks.  She's a good eater!<br /><br />Before I switched to Felidae Grain free, my cat was vomiting frequently.  I think it was due to food allergies (either to grain or food coloring maybe)  Since switching she has only thrown up one time! You can only imagine how happy I am to not have to clean up vomit every other day!<br /><br />Also, since switching my cat's fur is much more smooth and soft!

summary: Our Baby's Favorite Dinner
review: The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.

summary: Definitely a good breakfast indeed!
review: Not too bold, not too weak...not bitter.  Good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees.  My husband and I have added the Wolfgang Puck "Breakfast in Bed" line and the "Rodeo Drive" flavors to our buying ritual.

summary: Baci's are pure heaven - great gift, stocking stuffer!
review: My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term "Baci Pill" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!

summary: Wow!
review: I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart. I highly recommend it, but ask your local grocers to see if they're willing to carry it. This is far too expensive than what I paid going to my grocery store.

summary: Very good!
review: i have used the icicle a few times, and it sounds great! everything works how it's supposed to, and it is a very simple but efficient interface. the ONLY thing that i can see that's wrong with it, is it just feels light and cheap. granted its only around $40 so you can't expect too much from it. the plastic just feels rather cheap. but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i don't foresee a major problem on that front.

summary: Good Stuff
review: Whole family liked all three flavors.  We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly, I think they're a little bit better than the other brands we've had.

summary: Best of the Tassimo's
review: We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.

summary: Great Low Carb Replacement for Salt and Vinegar Potato Chips
review: I love Salt and Vinegar potato chips, but can't eat them on my low-carb diet. These pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high-carb snacks. The salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what I am used to finding in most potato chip brands, but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt-and-vinegar snack. The pork skins are light and fluffy, with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins. If the flavoring was a bit more pronounced, I would give this snack five stars.

review: Please don't tell me this is going to be a "seasonal" find only!!!  I made the pink lemonade cake with the pink lemonade frosting for July 4th and it was such a big hit!!!  The blend of lemon, sweet, and pink are just right!!!  When I went back to get more mixes they had been relegated to the "Seasonal Clearance" section -- and I could only find 2 cake mixes and no more frosting.  = (  It's definitely a year round keeper -- I'm thinking granddaughter birthday parties, ballet recital parties, pinkalicious parties!!!

review: This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.

review: I am not a coffee purist...but I am addicted.  I've dabbled in the flavorings & coffee-wannabe's, and this is by far my favorite.  I usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of Vanilla Caramel Latte, just so I have an extra afternoon shot of energy.  Extra bonus - when you pour the hot water over the mixture, it hisses & purrs :)

summary: True Bacon Flavor
review: These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet "Bacon" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that I'm going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many "bacon fanatics" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />CFH

review: Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!

review: These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all.

summary: Limited Relief, Better Than Nothing
review: Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea did not cure my heartburn.  In fact, I'm currently 29 weeks' pregnant, and have tried (with my doctor's approval) Tums, Pepcid (famotidine), Papaya Enzymes, pathetically bland food and loads of vanilla ice cream, but nothing has singlehandedly *cured* my heartburn.<br /><br />However, this tea does help, depending on the type and severity of the heartburn.  Marshmallow, the useful ingredient, works by helping to coat your stomach and digestive tract.  When one of my friends recommended this tea to me, she explained, "It won't stop the acid from being produced, or stop it from coming up, but it will make the whole experience less painful and nasty."  I couldn't agree more.  Subsequently, it's not as effective for combating the I-shouldn't-have-eaten-that-salsa type of heartburn, but is pretty useful for the 2-am-lying-in-bed-without-gravity-to-help-keep-food-down-it-just-won't-stay-down type of heartburn.  In fact, pair the Earth Mama tea with sleeping in a recliner, and the 2 am burn is no longer one of my concerns.<br /><br />The taste of the tea is sort of grassy with a bit of mint.  I don't find it too bitter to drink without a sweetener.  My best tip for making the tea work well is to start drinking it before the heartburn becomes a problem.  I usually brew a large cup to have with my dinner, then reserve a few mouthfuls' worth of the tea to sip during the night when I wake up.  The taste is fine when the tea is cold, and I find it no less effective.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea.

summary: burnt toast
review: Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. I've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help.

summary: Great packaging.  Decent price.  OK expiration date.
review: These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

summary: Packaging was sufficient
review: This review is for the packaging and not the actual mix, since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and, some wrote about how poor the packaging was. All I can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling, on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to. Granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags, there are more than enough instructions to go by.

summary: Average quality French roast
review: I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.

summary: Toddler candy
review: I think these are a bit boring (I like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice-enabled) but they do undeniably taste like peas, and my toddler begs for them ("peas! peas!"). I suspect she likes the crunchiness. I bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today. I think they'd probably be good in homemade trail mix, too.

summary: Yummy!
review: Got this for like $10 on a warehouse deal. It was a bargain! I received them in early May and the label says best before June. At a rate of one can per 2-3 days, I don't think I'll have a problem finishing them off before June. (I know, I have a sweet tooth). All 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good. They were just as described - soft cheese balls (about 20 per can) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom. Warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture.

summary: My kids LOVE them
review: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.

summary: Delicious
review: Like Izze, the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice. No sugar, no HFCS, no preservatives, no coloring; just 100% fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water. Fruits listed are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola (whatever that is).<br /><br />Intriguingly, the can mentions "contains soy" at the end of the ingredients list. There's no protein content listed, so it must be a trace amount. Something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy, however.<br /><br />Flavor is fantastic. I'd have a hard time choosing between it and Izze, but I think I might just give Switch the edge.

summary: Delicious tea!
review: I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.

summary: Hard as a Rock
review: First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought!

summary: Too good to continue for long.
review: For you spicy lovers, these jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos are for you. The taste is great and I admit I did not expect them to be this good. One day I picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week I had about 4 empty bags in my Trash cans. Office snack a must! Unfortunately this product is too good to last and I fear it will meet the same fate as Wasabi Funyuns. Rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster. So enjoy these Awesome Jalape&ntilde;o Cheetos for as long as they last.

summary: Excellent smooth, light coffee.  Good anytime.
review: Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.  I thought I'd already found my perfect coffee in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV68">Timothy's World Coffee, Breakfast Blend for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> but this one edges it out.  Smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop.<br /><br />There will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light-medium roast, give the Breakfast in Bed blend a try.  Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.  But, be aware and contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees, the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine. This one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way.<br /><br />Those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere.

summary: my favorite prize for students
review: Grandpa Po's Originals are my students' favorite prize for the classroom. Our school district has banned junk food for incentives for kids so Grandpa Po's is a perfect fit. The kids get a bag when they complete all of their assignments for the month. They love the snack and they work hard to get all their work done. Their parents love the reward too and many students come back to buy more to take home to the family. Thanks, Grandpa Po for your "better than food" snack!

summary: Great caramels
review: Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt.

summary: hard to find in New York, glad amazon can deliver it
review: This coffee was really good.  Been trying to find it in New York, but haven't been able to.  I think it's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered.  I've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic.  Also, I think the caffeine content is pretty high, as I'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands.

summary: Light, sparkling fresh peach flavor !!
review: I love Kristian Regale Black Currant sparkling drink- so thought I'd try the peach.  I never know if I'm going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when I get peach flavored items, but this was really good- somewhat tart, and tastes like fresh peaches.  The bubbles are tiny- so not like regular sodas, but a 'grown up' sparkling beverage.  I will order this again, and would have no trouble giving this as a gift- if I didn't drink it all first !!  I hope Amazon gets the pear flavored (not the listing for 50+ bucks, either.  I'm sure that would be good as well... but the peach and black currant are definite winners !!

summary: Paper Thin, Crispy and Good!
review: I was looking forward to this order from Amazon. I've been on a calorie restricted diet for months and it's the taste of grains (bread, chips, crackers)that I miss the most. I find these Thin Crispbreads from Kavli to be the perfect solution. They are ultra thin. I mean they are thinner than you might think possible.<br /><br />As soon as I saw the first one I was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece. So far I have not come across a single broken cracker. My next thought was...."well, as soon as I bite into it, the thing's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards. I was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been. These crackers really hold together nicely.<br /><br />The flavor is very plain. There is no seasoning, and very little salt. they taste like the grains they are made from. I have ordered a case of the "Garlic" flavor and look forward to trying them. I eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and eggplant spread that makes for a very low calorie snack. I highly recommend these.

summary: NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!
review: As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for "alive and aware raw cacao" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say "out of stock" or "currently unavailable" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the "brands" and "vendors" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said "alive and aware" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food "of the Gods" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!

summary: Price nearly doubled in less than 2 months?
review: I love these crackers but not the price change.<br /><br />At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for "Subscribe and Save" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for "Subscribe and Save" delivery.<br /><br />Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.<br /><br />Bait and switch?<br /><br />I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.<br /><br />As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a "Prime" member.<br /><br />I'll need to cancel my "Subscribe and Save" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.<br /><br />I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.<br /><br />It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.

summary: Truly pure is better
review: My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says "Enriched with organic lemon juice" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I don't know. I had about three sips and couldn't stomach it.

summary: disapointed
review: I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.

summary: Good N Strong
review: I am trying many different coffees to see which one's I like best. This coffee was good, but a little stronger than I had expected. I know it say's extra bold, but others I've tried have not been that "extra". I ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then. There was a little after taste, but not much more than other coffees. I would recommend it if you like stronger coffees, but it is not as strong as an espresso. I intend to purchase this again.

summary: They're Good Seeds.
review: These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.  Will buy again.  I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time.  So we grind a week's worth at a time.  Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods.

summary: Packed in the wrong oil.
review: It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best.

summary: Fantastic!  Cured My Pregnancy Heartburn
review: WOW!  I didn't expect that this would work last night, but it did!  I had the worst case of heartburn at 10 weeks along, and after not being able to eat dinner and 4 tums, it wasn't getting any better.  My best friend just bought me the Earth Mama Angel Baby tea sampler the other day and I had a lightbulb moment, remembering the heartburn tea was in there.  I figured it was worth a shot, not having eaten dinner and feeling nauseous and miserable.  Within a half an hour, the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the hearburn finally eased.  I'm not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review, but am hoping this might help some other mamas 2 be in need as well.  I am putting in an order to get some more of this today.  Will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work.  The taste is very nice too, so I am beyond pleased!

It's smooth ....has an excellent taste and aroma.<br /><br />We are totally satisfied with this order .....

summary: Nice, Big Pieces & Big Almond Flavor
review: These were shipped out the day after I ordered them and arrived within 5 days.  (I live on the opposite coast where these are made.)  My order arrived nicely packaged.  For the price, I got 1 lbs. 4 oz. of biscotti (I weighed it on my kitchen scale) cut into 10 big pieces.  Add the shipping and handling, and that comes out to a little more than $2 per piece.  This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten "as is" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.  And, the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked.<br /><br />I like the almond flavor, but I wish this came in anise flavor.  That's my favorite biscotti flavor.

review: I was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer (sorry to say, cheaper than it is sold here, even with subscribe and save....).  First thing I made was my childhood favorite - dumplings - and they were just like I remembered them to be!  The whole family was happy with them - they were such a big hit!  I can't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer.  I have never been able to duplicate the taste of Bisquick with any other gf recipe, and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same, in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, General Mills!

summary: tangy orange-y bubbly stuff .... yum!
review: I like carbonated fruit juices and I think this one is fine.  It has a more tangy formula than the name suggests; it's more of a light fruit punch.  It's refreshing and a good serving size, in my opinion.  It's wonderful to have something that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup!  What's here instead is: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c), contains soy.  Delicious.  Sweet.  Light.  Fruity.  Tangy.  Yum.

summary: Good Flavor
review: I am a coffee lover. It is one of the few pleasures of my life so I was excited to review this product.  Once received I opened it up and gave a good sniff.  I know to some that may sound stupid, but I love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me, this coffee did not do that as much as others that I have used.  I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.<br /><br />I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, "ummm this is really good."  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.<br /><br />Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.  Hubby liked it a lot. So I would have to say it was a winner, a good rich coffee flavor and a good price.

summary: BEST BLUEBERRIES
review: In the winter when fresh blueberries exceed our food budget these dried blue berries are fine for muffins, breads and puddings.<p>  We also enjoy fruit on our cereal.  In the winter it is often oatmeal and we sprinkle these blueberries on a bowl of oatmeal - wonderful on a cold morning.

summary: 2nd Birthday Saviour!
review: This mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party.  They turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing, they were a hit with everyone!  I even used Ener G's egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for.  One hint, bake for almost the maximum time on the directions.  They come out golden brown and moist.

review: I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates' dogs. It looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly.

summary: Wonderful!!
review: I'm so glad I found this seller.  I just purchased my Keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box.  It was fun picking out all the flavors I wanted to try.  If you go over to her website, [...], there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock.  After purchasing, I immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests. I received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later!  How's that for customer service? And the shipping was lightning fast!  I just received my package today (Monday) after ordering Thursday night.  All cups are accounted for and I'm already enjoying one of the cups I received.  If you are new to Keurig, or want to experiment with some new flavors, this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want!

summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever.

summary: Good brew but...
review: This is a good brew for the time and expense involved. That being said, the longer you ferment and bottle condition, the better it will be. I thought I had drank all of my batch when I discovered two additional bottles tucked away. They were the best and they had sat for a good three months. Give it time. If you follow the included directions you will get closer to six gallons vs the five in the Amazon description. Additionally, the included directions state to use sugar. Obviously DME/LME will work better, but you can still use plain old old sugar(I've used brown sugar and avoided any "cider" like finish).  If you order the "full kit" it comes with carbonation drops and a dextrose adjunct. Save yourself the money, get this kit, use sugar and bottle condition forever...

review: My husband has been taking this Sinus Buster tea once a day (before bedtime) for about 6 months already, he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone. This tea is so wonderful and it really helps.  When he skipped for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again. Don't want to skip it for so long anymore. Highly recommended.

summary: Convenient
review: Following a plant based diet, I use tofu almost daily.  It is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge.  These packages sit perfectly on a shelf.  They are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu (12 oz vs 16 oz).  They are also silk tofu so they don't hold  their shape as well, which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse.  Not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips.

review: Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect.

summary: DELICIOUS
review: I've been using this "low acid" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an "acid stomach", especially the "morning after".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.

summary: Pretty Good Decaf
review: I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light.

review: there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.

summary: good coffee - brews hot
review: finally some new varieties of tassimo ... I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..it's not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just don't like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this one's a keeper...

summary: This picky eater loves them (most flavors)
review: I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is "sweet" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.

summary: Weird texture; too dry and crumbly...
review: I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.

summary: We couldn't tell the difference in a blind taste test.
review: My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldn't tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldn't buy them again.

summary: Nice mellow cup of coffee!
review: I bought this grudgingly because my favorite Timothy's Italian Blend was out of stock...... and I was very happily surprised! It's not as "big"  and winey a brew as my favorite, but was flavorful, had a delicious aroma and was smooth. I tend to like rather potent coffee but I have clients who prefer a little lighter cup..... this will be perfect! I will happily keep buying this coffee. Thanks Wolfgang!

review: Read one of the chia books out there. This really is a super food.<br /><br />The only down side is the price gouging here on Amazon. Chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk bins for around $9.50/lb. $20/bag here is ridiculous.

summary: Just Great
review: I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no "artificial" taste at all. They're generous in size (3-4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120-140 each depending on the variety), they have 3-4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast.

summary: Popchips - Love !
review: I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family.

summary: pleased
review: I am pleased the bag is so large; it means I'll be sipping this tea for a while.  This tea is perfect for the start of the work day:  the rose and hibiscus liven my senses; the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as I climb over a hillock of e-mails.  The flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends I've mixed on my own (is the cause the mysterious "natural flavor" another reviewer pointed out?), but it is still quite pleasant.  I certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou.

summary: A disappointment...
review: I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin...

summary: An ideal breakfast
review: It's balanced, it's tasty, it's filling, it's good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?<br /><br />I still miss Kellogg's sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best.

summary: Great Taste, Crunchy
review: I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!

summary: Meh
review: The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.

summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review: I was swayed to try this thanks to Amazon's new add-on program. Cod roe pasta is surprisingly good, especially with the toasted nori! I used 100 grams of angel hair pasta with one packet of the sauce. Next time, I may reduce the amount of pasta, or use two packets of sauce, to up the flavor. A dash of red pepper might be good, too.

summary: This is their best bar by far
review: Santanders 53% semi-sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.<br /><br />I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one - the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich/creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.<br /><br />If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and/or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life.

review: Purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends - It is great and attractive! A note to purchasers: we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns, if you contact the seller directly they will work with you. The seller send me a replacement vial (very quickly) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it.  Will definitely get this set for others (maybe even me) in the future.

summary: Everyone Should To Try These At Least Once
review: If I had to describe a Popchip, I would say that it's a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake.  I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).  If you're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a must-try.

summary: Worth The Money!
review: These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.

review: Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat.

summary: Could have been better
review: I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites.

summary: picky puppy...
review: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

summary: Have to make the tea strong.
review: I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.

review: If you like Werther's hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like "do I have all my fillings?" sticky.<br /><br />Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really aren't. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.<br /><br />Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!

review: This product was a gift to a far distant relative.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket.  I cannot attest to the food personally, but she loved it!

summary: Koma is delicious
review: I don't drink soda and have no interest in energy drinks - I love coffee. However, I enjoy chamomile tea before bed. This calming beverage is a great alternative to tea - especially in hot weather. I will be ordering more - wish it were available locally.

summary: Really good product but not as good as "real" Bisquik
review: I purchased this while out of town.  We used it a couple of times, but never for biscuits.  I did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good.  Always use milk and butter.<br /><br />They are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them, but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there. I did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that.  I used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good.  I would like to try this again  for pancakes, and make some biscuits before I make a final decision on it.

Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.

summary: Carrot Juice???? Really????
review: Talk about horrible . . .<br />I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.<br /><br />I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn't change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.<br /><br />If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don't even think they should call it that . . .<br /><br />I don't normally do it, but I am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket.  I also think I should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad.

review: I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Belly's are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesn't seem overly hygienic. Since I didn't open the box for a few months the Jelly Belly's were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded

summary: a Chocolate treat
review: My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.

summary: great alternative for coffee drinkers
review: This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.  Maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend, but I'm so thankful for it.  Really close in taste.

summary: Love 'em, they're great!
review: The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.<br /><br />I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again.

summary: Good idea, but needs some work
review: This is a great idea, but i find that the grounds get into the coffee, and the coffee doesn't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups.  It is messy as it comes out and misses the mug.  It still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal.

summary: Applesauce Spice Cake
review: As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!

summary: Quailty coffee for the region and price
review: I have a Keurig coffee maker. You know, the one with the K-Cups.  To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced.

summary: Just like the Bisquick you remember
review: I find the gluten-free Bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original Bisquick, and I like the flavor just fine (not much different than regular Bisquick).  It's easy to make the pancakes, just add milk, oil, an egg, mix, and pour on the griddle.  Cooking time seems to be about the same, and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes.  I would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten-free products.

summary: Misleading product!!! If you want no bees, then use it.
review: There's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!

summary: Nice and thin
review: This crispbread is nice and thin - great for those with more sensitive teeth.<br /><br />I eat 3 of these in the morning for breakfast with Smuckers Sugar-Free jelly on them.<br />Guilt free and delicious.<br /><br />You do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter.<br />If you press too hard they can break.<br /><br />One thing you can't tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air-tight packs in the box.<br /><br />I'm currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbread.<br />Highly recommend both.<br /><br />Note: I have lost 12 pounds by changing my diet but I give the most credit to 2 things.  Rye crispbread replacing almost<br />all of the flour in my diet.  And drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat.<br />You do need to exercise a little bit too.

summary: Reduced spit-up and a happier baby!
review: This formula is a life-saver!  Our 2-month old had a little viral bug, which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy.  With this formula, he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier!<br /><br />Ask your doctor for a sample!  When we took our baby in for his tummy troubles, the doc gave us a full-sized can of this formula to take home and try!  Considering it costs about $14 retail, this was great!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Reduced spit-up and gas<br />Reduced fussiness<br />Easy to mix up<br /><br />Cons:<br />Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digest<br /><br />You can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website.  Great product and great customer service!

review: This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;)

summary: Not very busy...
review: My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes.

summary: It's like Buttah!
review: Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.<br /><br />Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.<br /><br />If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin.

summary: At least it wasn't expensive.
review: With <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first "unofficial" producers of "we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite "diet" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK">Splenda</a>" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want." and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious "diet" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.

review: I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink, it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant.

review: We got our Senseo coffee maker through a promotion. I had always wanted to try it out. I purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and I tried them out. We have yet to be disappointed. We love it so much, we have told several people about the Senseo and they have gotten them as well. This is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee. In fact, I think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the Senseo coffee pods. Pair the pods with The Barista Blend flavor packs, sit back and enjoy.

summary: Way too SALTY!!
review: The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.<br /><br />I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.<br /><br />Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt.

summary: Great taste, safe & Natural
review: I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is "store fat!" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the "during taste" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!

review: Finally a GREAT decaf. It has a really wonderful and complete flavor- not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick. I use a Jura Capresso super automatic to make my espresso- it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine (since it is pre-ground). The flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes. This is my every day decaf espresso. I haven't found anything better and I've tried a lot. The Illy decaf is comperable in flavor/ quality but at about double the price the Illy just isn't worth it.

summary: Tasty & Not Too Sweet
review: I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168A9KG">Orange Crush Case 4-6pk</a> because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQUCG">San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles</a>.<br /><br />Dare I say it? Yes. The flavor and size make it a perfect mixer. After my intial sip, I immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka.

summary: Inferior for pancakes
review: The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bob's Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes.

summary: Ok if you need to figure out what you like
review: The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.<br /><br />It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.

summary: Tasty and Good for Weight Watchers!
review: OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the "club" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience.

review: I've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice I've ever had was obtained at Ikea. It was from Sweden. Yum! In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

summary: My Husband is Italian, but I cheat on him with Greek Olive Oil
review: I am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years.  I have to say, hands down, this is my favorite olive oil.  It's affordable and non-pretentious.  Amazing flavor.  I use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to drag a piece of crusty bread through or to drizzle over caprese.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking and unsure of what to buy.. because who knows?  But this one is a keeper and a must try!

The cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free.  It's still good baking soda though, and kudos to the Bob's Red Mill marketing department.  You guys are geniuses.

summary: No effect for this sinus sufferer
review: I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt.

summary: Good for packaged ground coffee
review: This is good for packaged ground coffee, and for decaf, it definitely has a strong coffee flavor. This is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that won't keep you up because of the caffeine.<br /><br />Each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra-fine ground coffee. The bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging.<br /><br />With coffee prices going up, it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this (if you try this and like it, you get a better price with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you.

summary: Unremarkable
review: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

summary: Not spicy enough.
review: If you're used to Dave's Insanity sauce, or like me you're used to Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce, you're going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces aren't spicy at all. They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings.

summary: Greatest healthy snack
review: These almond rice pops are a very healthy snack.  17 cubes are 2 points in weight watchers and you feel like you are cheating. They are oven baked, all natural and extremely tasty.  Biggest problem is they are very hard to find. Almond Pops with Blueberry used to be sold at Costco but no longer. Can't find those anywhere<br />I order often and in volume because my friends all like them too so I share my orders with them<br />Expensive snack but well worth it

summary: Way too weak for my tastes
review: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

summary: Entire family loves them
review: loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them.  low fat, lower calorie and all natural, simple snack for kid's lunch bags. It is peanut and tree nut free (safe for allergy kids) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat, I bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet.

summary: Generally a good product, but quality is NOT consistent
review: I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did.

summary: Great taste, but ---
review: I really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order.  So I went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it.  At only 8.3 oz. for about a dollar, that's roughly the equivalent of $1.50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz. soft drink.  Our budget isn't going to justify ongoing purchases of this product.  If we had more discretionary money, we might do it, but it'd be more of a treat than a regularly used product (partly because of the small size).  So the taste was at least 4-stars, but the price brought it down considerably - even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks.

summary: More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand
review: My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.

summary: Wonderful for orphan foal with digestive problems
review: Our QH mare gave birth to a beautiful Clydesdale/Quarter Horse cross colt 3 weeks ago. It was her first baby and not only did she reject him, but she attacked him. Then he was attacked by a dog because his mother was not protecting him. He spent the first 7 days of his life in an equine neonatal intensive care unit. Regular mare's milk replacer gave him diarrhea, so they added goats milk, which stopped the diarrhea. When we brought him home, we looked for a constant source of goat milk to add to his formula. The Meyenberg powdered goat milk works great! We add it to his formula and he loves it. Even better, he is able to digest his milk better and is thriving. Thank you Amazon and Meyenberg for a product that helped to save our foal's life.

summary: no complaints
review: We don't drink much coffee, and less decaf, but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit. Everybody has been pleased with the Melitta. Nobody has complained about the taste, and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they weren't just being politely quiet. We got the first sample free through the Vine program but I would buy it in the future.

summary: Great Starter plant
review: Item arrived in less than a week. Packaging was great. Old newspaper to fill in black space, and the leaves of the plant were tucked inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed.  There was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity.<br /><br />All leaves were green and healthy, not many traps were closed. It had two adult plant, one juvenile one. I separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot wouldn't have been long enough for their roots (They like over 4 inches of room for their roots if it can be helped). Fast forward 6 months, my collections has grown, and these original Venus Fly Traps have  been propagating with secondary growth points. They're growing like weeds!<br /><br />Don't forget, they like sun and distilled water. But be careful when you first get them. Put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning.

summary: No bitterness great flavor and it does work
review: Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product.

review: The sodium and sugar (often corn syrup) in tomato sauces is frightening.  Plus, w/them you eat white pasta to boot but w/salsa you eat rice and beans.  Trust me - don't buy your sauces around your meals, get salsa and plan meals around it.<br /><br />They arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh, I was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock.  The vendor did really well.

summary: Love the Earth's Best brand usually, but...
review: I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up).

summary: Pretty nice plant!!!
review: The plant looked great the day it arrived. With that said, the arrival took an extra week to get here. After the first day one of the heads turned blacked and i had to remove it. I give it 4 hours of direct sunlight a day and always keep the media wet. I never use tap water. Only rain and purifies water. I still have yet to see any of the heads open. I'm very nervous that they will not ever open. Maybe they will send me another one :/

summary: Exactly what is claims to be!
review: I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it.

review: Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.

summary: Surprisingly good and no nausea!
review: I didn't have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try!

summary: These sure don't taste like ketchup to me!
review: I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!

summary: Makes THE BEST risotto!
review: If you want to make authentic Italian risotto for a reasonable price, buy this rice! Vialone Nano is - in my opinion - the very best for making risotto. You have to follow the true process, starting with sweated shallots, then parching the rice, then deglazing with white wine, and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often. If you follow this procedure (and/or find a good recipe), you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest, most mouth-meltingly tender rice you've ever had. Why pay for it in a restaurant when it's so easy to make at home?

review: This stuff will give you a marked energy boost. Note that every person is different.  For me, this lasted 3 hours before the crash.  (Not a sugar crash.) But my heart was pounding like it wanted to burst through my chest.<br /><br />So I only drink half at a time (like another reviewer) and it works, without the scary heart acceleration.<br /><br />It's even tasty.

review: I originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack.  When my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately.  It is super yummy waffle mix.  The waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them.  Here I am on amazon.com placing yet another order for this Waffle mix, it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone's favorite breakfast item.

summary: Just Right and you will love it!
review: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

summary: Awesome tofu @ a great price!
review: My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this tofu as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the individual packaging of the tofu (and the fact that it doesn't need to be refrigerated), the taste and texture, and the overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids also love this tofu as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Roland White Miso Paste (incredible flavor and great quality) and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu (this stuff), 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 TBS white miso paste, 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is... We live in Northern California with some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world, but this recipe blows away (or at least equals) what you can get from any restaurant. But I digress... I highly recommend this tofu!

summary: AWESOME!
review: I may be dating myself here a bit but I remember when the first Soft Batch cookies came out.  These were the first and they were bigger and yes, even softer than these are now.  But, at that time, they were the ONLY soft, prepackaged cookie (can you believe that?) besides Archway.  They then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason, they stopped making them.  I can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so I'm wondering why they stopped.<br /><br />Anyway, back to today, these cookies, even though they're smaller, are still quite excellent.  They are just so soft and taste better than Keebler's other soft and chewy cookies.  This package made it about 20 minutes in this house - that's what happens when you're raising a bunch of Titan boys!<br /><br />Great, great stuff, HIGHLY recommend!

summary: Healthy, but not really tasty
review: I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat. It's a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldn't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.

review: Great vanilla beans at a great price.  I recieved about 60 beans in my pack.  They are plump and perfect.  When I've used them all up I will definitely be buying them again!  I almost didn't order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them. I'm glad I didn't listen to them.  They smell like all of the other vanilla beans that I've bought.

The smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it'd be to spend them with Erin, have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard.<br /><br />The only thing is that this kind and the other kind (raisin) don't differ much in taste. They both taste the same--taste of Heaven.

review: I love coffee anytime of day. But sensibly I drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours. And a flavored coffee is a real treat. But some can be overpowering. This "Jamaican Me Crazy" flavor not only suits my personality(HA), it is very pleasing to the palate. The flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed. And oh, the aroma is delicious! Both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee. I will definitely purchase this again.

summary: Really like it.
review: I have read a couple of the studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that it's worth a try (as a 57-YO athlete).  I like this product b/c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number-of-cherry equivalents in the studies I've read.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the label, but I've no reason to doubt it.  I've grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer!

review: While I love flavored coffees, I had never tried any of the Wolfgang Puck line.  This moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup!  Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a "coconut" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!

summary: Great, high-quality cat food
review: I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.

summary: A truly energizing, natural elixir!
review: I make coconut water a part of my daily regimen, whether I've exercised or not. It gives my body a much better - and healthier - boost than caffeine, and gives me an overall feeling of well-being. I recommend this to everyone, the only downside is one could go broke drinking a liter box every day like I've been doing.

review: I've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice I've ever had was obtained at Ikea. It was from Sweden. Yum! In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

summary: An EXCELLENT hazelnut choice for your Keurig brewer...
review: I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out.

summary: A Tasty, Mildly Carbonated Fruit Juice Soda
review: This is almost the kind of fruit soda I'd make if I were going into this business. The difference is that I'd go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).<br /><br />For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.<br /><br />My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.  Cheers!

summary: Overpriced, Even on Gold Box
review: This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is "definitely a keeper." What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be.

review: I had to try this Orange Tangerine flavor because I had tried the watermelon/strawberry and didn't like it very much, but wanted to give this company another shot. I do prefer this Orange tangerine; it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation. I give it a 3, better then the watermelon/strawberry and on ice I drank the whole can.

summary: My Dog Loves This Food
review: My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merrick's Grammy's Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery.

summary: Good, but container could be better
review: I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better, but switched because it became too expensive. So this is the cheeper option. The taste is the same, but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee. I don't like the container. It doesn't pour well, so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle, so that I don't have a sticky mess on my counter every day. It's fine for the price. I continue to have it shipped to me every other month.

summary: Diabetic Delight
review: These chocolates are a welcome find.  They taste the same as regular chocolate but they don't spike my blood sugar.  I treat myself to a couple at a time when I have a sweet tooth.  It's great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar.  And fortunately the Maltitol doesn't seem to bother my digestive system.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I found a great bulk deal at another online source.

summary: Do not miss the salt!
review: Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!

summary: Terrific Decaf Tea
review: My Mom was born in Manchester, England,and I have been drinking tea since I was very young. A few years ago I was forced to switch to decaf tea. Most of the blends available are terrible. I used to drink regular Yorkshire tea, and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong, full-bodied tea, and I love it! I decided to purchase from Amazon because I knew I could count on them, as  well  as their outside vendors. I was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again.

summary: Bite sized
review: I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.

review: I grew up eating Bisquik, so finding a gluten-free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful.  However, a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes!  I would love it if the GF Bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional Bisquik - especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones.

summary: YUMMY!!!
review: I recently discovered that I have sensitivities to dairy and wheat, so I have been trying gluten free products.  I knew about Hodgson Mill because of their Oat Bran hot cereal, which is really good and soothes my tummy.  Consequently, I ordered Hodgson Mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix, as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix.  Both have proven delicious.  Even my husband, who is not gluten sensitive, loves the pancakes.  I made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning, and they were really good and very filling.  Not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews, but I have no complaints, and I am very picky.  I just wish Hodgson Mill products were more readily available in our local stores.  If anyone has tried their gluten-free pasta, please post because Lundberg's rice pasta left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Thanks!

summary: Keurig DisposaKups
review: I have read mixed reviews on the DisposaKups, so I had no expectations.  I would like to say that the product has worked perfectly.  Maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid.  There was NO leaking at all and I have used 10 cups already.  I also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew.  That is true, probably due to the type of grind.  My resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place, but choose the smallest cup on the Keurig, which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee.  Lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup.  Viola!  Perfect.  I definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again.

summary: healthy & fun food!
review: For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding.

summary: Awful
review: The only other flavored coffee I've used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.<br /><br />Where the Nestle's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn't anything like hazelnut<br /><br />Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!<br /><br />More Info:<br />I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don't have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park.

review: Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there

summary: Happy with the purchase
review: Water tastes good. I typically prefer only purified water (did a study on this in grad school back in the day) but for use at the office, this fills the bill. I think it tastes good and looks presentable.<br /><br />Bottles are (of course) recyclable, so I don't feel guilty saying I like the quality of the bottle as well. I once had someone pickup water, and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal - but the bottle was so flimsy. I don't like that one bit. This is the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Shipment arrived fully intact for me.

I'm so glad I ordered it!  Choc  Rasp is the best flavor but Chocolate Hazelnut, Chocolate Mint, and Milk Chocolate are also excellent.

summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

summary: Way Too Salty
review: I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)

review: I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or "bark" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.

summary: Watch out for the FAT!
review: Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.<br /><br />Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.<br /><br />Terrific if that's what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what I'm looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert.

summary: Shipping by price, not weight?
review: a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price.<br />This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.

summary: Great chips!
review: For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.

summary: Chocolate Italian kisses - need I say more?
review: My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term "Baci Pill" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!

review: I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website.

summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
review: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

summary: Spicy Mustard
review: I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.  It actually does have enough heat to taste, without being excessive.  This mustard would make a great addition to any sauces, marinades, salad dressings, or just for dipping!  I would recommend this product, for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat.

review: I can't remember when I've had a cup of coffee so delicious, I immediately wanted another cup.  There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut-with-a-touch-of-the-islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!

This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup

summary: Best cereal bars on the planet
review: We use these for our daughter for a few reasons. One, they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market (whole grain). Two, they have yogurt incorporated into the bar. Three, the are thick and do not easily crumble. Since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1, not having to clean up after she's eaten them is a BIG plus.<br /><br />Plus, they are super yummy for adults too.<br /><br />They are more expensive than others on the market (esp since I can get Nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount) but they are worth it. Makes our life easier and they don't have a ton of added sugars!

summary: Gave me a boost when I needed it
review: I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.<br /><br />After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.<br /><br />It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer.

summary: A bolder Columbian
review: I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my "strong" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste.

summary: Horrible
review: I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.

summary: yeah, pancakes again!!!
review: Thank goodness Bisquick finally went Gluten -Free!  I have been 3 years diagnosed with Celiac, and besides pillsbury rolls, pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits!  We have eaten many pancakes since this product came out.  Way to go Betty Crocker!  Only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores.

summary: A taste that needs to be acquired...
review: I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I don't really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well...

summary: YUM.
review: These are probably the best crackers I've ever tasted.  They came in a Christmas gift basket, but I liked them so much that I had to google them to see how to get more.  This variety contains oregano, poppyseed, and garlic powder.  Because of how thin they are, there's nowhere for the flavor to hide!  Try them with smoked provolone.  I highly recommend them.

summary: A good surprise
review: I have been on GF diet for a month and it's hard to find food that taste good or even close to what I used to eat. But when my husband found Bisquick Gluten Free at the store, the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up. Actually my husband eats the GF pancakes wnow even if he doesn't need a gluten free diet. The pancakes are lighter and very tasty. Just follow the box directions.

summary: Bisquick GF - so delicious!
review: The first time we cracked open a box of Bisquick Gluten Free and made a batch of pancakes, I was surprised. They were DELICIOUS! Perhaps the best pancakes I've ever had. We did make a couple modifications from the box recipe. Instead of using oil, we use the same amount of melted butter. And we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it's cooking. Then, serve with whipped cream. So great! I'm looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this, including pizza crust.

summary: It works, but not as expected.
review: As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful.

summary: Cocoa wasn't bad. . .Price was horrible
review: The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(

summary: good in almost anything
review: I enjoy this flaxseed in everything I've tried it in so far. This product has a pleasant flavor, yet doesn't over power the foods I put it in. It helps to keep my digestive track regular. I ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything. My husband and I love it in pancakes. I enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream. I especially like it mixed in my yogurt. I highly recommend this product.

summary: Works - Sort of
review: I bought these tablets to try during lunch at work. Four of us each tried one tablet, tasted various foods, and noticed no difference. At that point, I gave up, but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each. They reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried, but many items remained unaffected. Among those that were was a fruit punch Powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive (like drinking pure sugar), and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven. Most other affected foods were impacted negatively.<br /><br />In all, we were unimpressed with these tablets. While they did accomplish their flavor-changing purpose, it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable. And the experience, though fun, was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required. I was really hoping for a bigger impact.

summary: Wonderful Product
review: I've given up on cows milk products....it interferes with my digestion, creates constipation and gas.  I decided to try this powdered goats milk because I remembered that my parents told me that I was allergic to cows milk when I was a baby and they gave me goats milk instead, but then switched me to cows milk when I was old enough to tolerate it.  I wish they had left me on the goats milk growing up because I find that my body tolerates it much better, and I think I would have been healthier as a child growing up if I'd had goats milk instead of cows milk.<br /><br />I use it to make my own kefir, yogurt, custards and whatever else I need milk for.  I was a bit dubious when I first bought it....I didn't know if I would like the taste of it or not, but....I love the taste and the smell of it.  Mmmmmm.....Yum. The taste at first reminded me a tiny bit of the flavor of lamb.....and I love lamb....but this taste is so slight that it's not noticable in kefir (which makes the most delicious pancakes), or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods.  I like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk.<br /><br />I also like the powdered milk because I can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time, as I need it, and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or spoiling.  It's very convenient.<br /><br />It takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it, but once it is all dissolved in the water, I can't tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk.  It dissolves and mixes quickest in a blender.

summary: VERY cool
review: I ordered these after hearing about them from some friends. I was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the "pill form". But WOW! They really do work! It makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet. I tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter. But the most noticeable was the lemon. I really didn't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to. It tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever. Seriously, it was like candy all of the sudden. I almost couldn't believe it. When a few friends were over i gave them a pill each and we all of the sudden lemons were the best thing ever lol!

summary: mellow flavor, no chemical aftertaste
review: This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.

review: i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet.  i thought they would be a little larger, but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog.  they were even a little small for my pug who gulped them down and i was afraid she would choke on them.

summary: Sweet and Refreshing!
review: I really enjoyed this drink!  I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If you're trying to cut back on pop, I highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat!

summary: Wonderful, easy to cook with.
review: I am fairly new to tofu but have already gone through 3 cases of this lovely tofu since the beginning of the year.<br />It's really great. Very mild flavour that is easily masked by what ever you cook it with.<br /><br />I make an awesome instant chocolate pudding with this stuff, a box of silken tofu, some dark cocoa powder, stevia and then a bit of milk to loosen it up. Whiz in a blender or food processor and it makes a super creamy, dreamy delight that I don't feel guilty about eating and leaves me more satisfied than your standard pudding. Chill it and it becomes a realllllllllllllly thick, luscious mousse. (making myself hungry)<br /><br />Anyhoo, I love that it's a shelf stable product that I can have on hand for impromptu meals.<br /><br />Sometimes I make burgers by mixing it with smoked paprika, garlic, onion, nutritional yeast, oatmeal, masa flour, bit of nice oil until a thick consistency and fry up and they're just fantastic.<br /><br />I think this is one of those foods that's so versatile and easy to play with and gives you a nice bit of protein to your diet.

summary: Limited Relief, Better Than Nothing
review: Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea did not cure my heartburn.  In fact, I'm currently 29 weeks' pregnant, and have tried (with my doctor's approval) Tums, Pepcid (famotidine), Papaya Enzymes, pathetically bland food and loads of vanilla ice cream, but nothing has singlehandedly *cured* my heartburn.<br /><br />However, this tea does help, depending on the type and severity of the heartburn.  Marshmallow, the useful ingredient, works by helping to coat your stomach and digestive tract.  When one of my friends recommended this tea to me, she explained, "It won't stop the acid from being produced, or stop it from coming up, but it will make the whole experience less painful and nasty."  I couldn't agree more.  Subsequently, it's not as effective for combating the I-shouldn't-have-eaten-that-salsa type of heartburn, but is pretty useful for the 2-am-lying-in-bed-without-gravity-to-help-keep-food-down-it-just-won't-stay-down type of heartburn.  In fact, pair the Earth Mama tea with sleeping in a recliner, and the 2 am burn is no longer one of my concerns.<br /><br />The taste of the tea is sort of grassy with a bit of mint.  I don't find it too bitter to drink without a sweetener.  My best tip for making the tea work well is to start drinking it before the heartburn becomes a problem.  I usually brew a large cup to have with my dinner, then reserve a few mouthfuls' worth of the tea to sip during the night when I wake up.  The taste is fine when the tea is cold, and I find it no less effective.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend Earth Mama Angel Baby Organic Heartburn Tea.

summary: Highest in protein
review: Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight.

summary: Tasty but Salty
review: So for a "healthier" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt.

summary: Perfect Hot Choc Variety Box
review: We love this variety box in our house, we subscribe to ensure we never run out.  I use the 'Dark' to make Mocha, my wife loves the 'Peppermint' and i drink the 'Milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate.<br /><br />The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful.<br /><br />Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. :-)

We just made waffles this morning, and both my husband and I were floored at how good they were!  The outside was crisp and the inside was soft.  With that said, it's not that great for pancakes or coffeecake.

summary: Tasty, Quick Meal
review: These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.

review: These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all.

review: I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic.

I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.<br />This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook.

summary: Wonderful low-carb light and crispy cracker
review: The title just about says it all.  These crackers (crispbread, if you will) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each.  I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips, as well as "conveyers" for cheese and other goodies.  They have become my favourite snack.  Yes, they are bland, but I like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and don't overpower.

summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

summary: Cats won't eat it
review: I've been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness.

summary: the only jarred baby food my son ate
review: From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.

summary: Great snacking alternative!
review: For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!

summary: Tastes like an energy drink
review: I was surprised at the ingredient list and "100% natural" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I don't really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.<br /><br />I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If you're the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks "I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice", then this is the product you've been dreaming of.

summary: tasty, lightly carbonated, good alternative for soda-pop
review: If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas.

review: The DisposaKups are great because I can use my own brand coffee and adjust the strength of it. The only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be trimmed down to prevent leakage.  At first try it is a little difficult to get the tops on but after a few times of doing it, it becomes easier.  The price is a little steep for me but much less than buying the already filled K-kups.  I feel sure that I will order this product again.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TSAZO0">DisposaKups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers - 50 Cups, Lids, Filters - 100% Disposable - FREE PRIME SHIPPING</a>

review: Fruit juice has lots of calories, so at home, we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice. We like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink. The Switch is a portable alternative - a little carbonation, nice flavor, more like tangerine than orange, and 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. When convenience is important, The Switch is a good, healthier alternative to soda.

summary: A great healthy alternative to soda pop...
review: My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review: I have had all of the various Keurigs since they came on the market for home use. Thus,I have tried pretty near all of the various k-cups. This is one of my top 5 favorites. Love the coconut in it, and the wonderful coffee flavor. YUM!!!!

summary: Great baby food
review: The other reviews are very outdated & old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it.

summary: Sorry Wolfgang!
review: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

summary: Nice rich flavor, good cup of coffee
review: We've only been using the k-cups about 2 months.  Both my wife and I like our coffee bold.  I've been guided by amazon reviews and started out with Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Although that is still my favorite, I got this French Roast on a Friday sale and would say that it's my new second choice.  I have also tried Coffee People's Black Tiger (a close third) and Kona (not a fan).  This is a nice, well-rounded every-day cup, more on the bold side but not wincingly so.

summary: I love it!!
review: This is the BEST!<br />Years ago, I used it & loved it! Moved & could not find it again. I have purchased many hot/sweet sauces over the years, trying to find this flavor. Recently, I found it again at World Market....now I'm addicted! Everyone has mentioned great ways to use it.<br />My favorite....I use it on my salads, along with a little fat-free dressing. Now, I eat tasty salads every day, (without the cheese!).<br /><br />Sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon....and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg!

summary: Premium made in the USA treats for dogs & cats!
review: One of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that's made in the USA (Connecticut) and isn't made in China.  Time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from CHINA.  Do NOT buy treats made in China for your pets!  Sure, these are a tad more expensive, but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet!  I call it kitty and dog candy!  They come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open.  They LOVE Bravo's real meat treats!

summary: One of the Greatest Gluten Free Products I've Found
review: This is one of the most versatile mixes I've found, and most recipes come out tasting very much like the Full of Gluten Blends. I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains.<br /><br />Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix. YAY for Mom!<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!

summary: Great service
review: I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.  They shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap.  None of the lollipops were broken in transit.<br /><br />It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume, I requested to return these as well.  I was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back, so the five stars are so the amazing service.<br /><br />Now I think we'll hand out the lollipops with the rest of our Halloween candy, which I think the kids in our neighborhood will love!

summary: Wonderful for orphan foal with digestive problems
review: Our QH mare gave birth to a beautiful Clydesdale/Quarter Horse cross colt 3 weeks ago. It was her first baby and not only did she reject him, but she attacked him. Then he was attacked by a dog because his mother was not protecting him. He spent the first 7 days of his life in an equine neonatal intensive care unit. Regular mare's milk replacer gave him diarrhea, so they added goats milk, which stopped the diarrhea. When we brought him home, we looked for a constant source of goat milk to add to his formula. The Meyenberg powdered goat milk works great! We add it to his formula and he loves it. Even better, he is able to digest his milk better and is thriving. Thank you Amazon and Meyenberg for a product that helped to save our foal's life.

summary: Awesome Chips!!!!!!!!!!!
review: I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it.

summary: smiles
review: Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.

summary: MAMMA MIA!!!!
review: Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My brother told me about these tablets and the "flavor tripping" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of "Ripley's Believe it or not" kind of novelty.<br />Anyway, the tablets WORK immediately. I just took one, had a lemon, and voila': it's SWEET! I also tried a sip of Chianti wine.. SWEET.... I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!<br />The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.<br />Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft-drink!! The possibilities are endless!

summary: Bitter taste
review: I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others.

summary: Excellent tasting coffee, naturally decaffeinated
review: This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many brands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again.

summary: Gluten free with good taste
review: The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's "Glutenfree Recipe Collection" magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick, it's easy, it tastes good, and it is versatile.  And hey- although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh!

summary: Good stuff
review: Researched the company, researched the ingredients. Customer Service people are great. Sent free coupons when e-mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties (regular or advanced).  Received good answers and not rote replies. This food is made in the USA with products from the USA and has all the ingredients I think are good for my cats. The two of them love, love this dry food and I have to ration it or they would chow day all day. I don't leave food out for any pet, cat or dog, to eat at will. They do not like Newman's canned food however so I don't force it on them.

review: I have been on GF diet for a month and it's hard to find food that taste good or even close to what I used to eat. But when my husband found Bisquick Gluten Free at the store, the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up. Actually my husband eats the GF pancakes wnow even if he doesn't need a gluten free diet. The pancakes are lighter and very tasty. Just follow the box directions.

Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended.

summary: Delicious little gummy bears
review: These bear cubs are great! They're just like the kind you can get at novelty candy stores only much cheaper than their $8-9/lb. In my opinion, the flavors of Albanese gummy bears are much better than Haribo's bears. I haven't experienced any powdery residue or a melted goop as previous reviewers had. My bears came to me in perfect condition and perfect packaging. If you like mini gummy bears, I suggest you give these a try.

review: I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE">Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>. Although the Senseo coffee is very good, I wanted some variety. This is what I found and its excellent. The vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly, leaves no after taste. I drink tall cups, 16 oz, so what I am doing is using 1 of each type. The vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great. The Senseo decaf is a little cheaper, so I do that as a cost saving measure. I also signed up for Subscribe and Save to further reduce cost.  If you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer, I am confident you will love this coffee.

summary: Seasoned well
review: I made the 10 bean soup with a few modifications.  I added carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes.  However, I did not have to adjust the seasoning.  This is not a bland soup.  Excellent!  I also gave Women's Bean soups, dips, and salsas to my extended family for Christmas.  Everyone loved the gift- it simplified my shopping, and I felt like I was helping those who really need the help.

summary: Great product just need to adjust the subscription.
review: My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.

summary: Our finicky eater's favorite food
review: This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.<br /><br />The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.<br /><br />It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well.

summary: Highest in protein
review: Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight.

summary: Made for one interesting night!
review: Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of "flavor tripping." That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.<br /><br />These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food.

summary: Great balance
review: I'm not a coffee snob. If I was, I doubt I'd own a Keurig. I just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup.<br /><br />I've tried many of the flavored coffees, but they're too gimmicky for me. Starbucks brand tastes burnt to me, even their blonde roast -- in stores I mean, I have not tried the Starbucks brand kcups.<br /><br />I like this breakfast blend because it's not too dark, not too light. It tastes like what no-frills coffee should taste like. I order the biggest size to get the best value.<br /><br />Update: I just tried to create a review for the "Jamaica Me Crazy" coconut flavor, which I thought was terrible. (And I *love* coconut.) I should specify that the original review was for "Breakfast in Bed."

review: I am glad nail deco has become to be adult deco and not just for little girls.  I am not sure why it started out for adults and dove downward for little chicks and now back up to where it is alright for all sizes of females.  You can also use items from junkyards, wooden catalogs, and other places not usually on the same channel as beauty materials for jewelry and accessories.

summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever.

review: I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn't do a bit of good.  Very disappointing.

summary: Great Dark Chocolate for Yourself or for Guests!
review: I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.  I'm happy with one square most days.<br /><br />These are a great non-guilty pleasure that are good for your health!

summary: Tangy and delicious snack
review: For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.

summary: Best Hot Cocoa
review: Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like "real" cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try.

summary: Wonderfully yummy
review: I was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name, and I wasn't disappointed.  There is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious,  I don't like strong coffee, and this is perfect for my husband and I.  I get it send regularly now and it's one of our favorites!  Second only to Jamaica Me Crazy by Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands.

summary: Variety matches the (current) picture
review: As a new Keurig owner, I'm trying as many "sampler" packs as possible to determine what both my husband and I like the most.<br /><br />Although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other "Crazy Cups" purchases have been received in, I am enjoying this variety thoroughly.  It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:<br /><br />Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.<br /><br />I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!<br /><br />If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift/house warming present for these hot summer months!  I don't mind them not being in a gift box, but I could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price.

review: Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt.

review: It's hard to find carrot juice  in stores so I gave it a try and ordered some juice from this seller via amazon....even so I felt kind of poshy doing so.<br />Well, I will do it again. My six bottles of juice were shipped super fast, packaging was very good. The juice itself is excellent. It is actually that rich in taste that I mix it half with water or apple juice. That way the already reasonable price  becomes even better.<br />I am really glad I gave it a try. Drinking a glas of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin.

summary: Go for the Goat!
review: Goat milk is very good for the digestive system.  Fortunately, it performs many functions that the medical world is not aware of.  I can remember in the 40's, my father curing his ulcers with goat milk.  He lived until the ripe old age of 94.  I have friends who have discarded Rx and over-the counter products, in favor of goat milk to solve their digestive problems.<br /><br />Even though regular goat milk lasts long in the refrigerator, powered goat milk lasts longer, and is easily made when you need it.  Plus, with the powder, you can customize the quality of the product to your taste.<br /><br />It's good for you and to you.

summary: NEWSFLASH
review: I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under "contact us" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh.

summary: Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either
review: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda "Orange Crush," although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike "Orange Crush," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.

summary: The best bad breath and no fowl after taste
review: Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.<br /><br />Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!

review: It is a lot of beans to go through but the flavor and quality is really nice. They are fresh, soft and very fragrant. I use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean. You must seal these very tightly to keep them soft but with care, they will stay nice for months and you can't beat the price! One company sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to $6! And the quality isn't anywhere near what these are. I will continue to buy this product. I've ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product.

I am 10 weeks pregnant and haven't felt like eating much these last few weeks, but tonight, the night before I have to fast for a blood draw, I was craving some banana moon pies.  Off to the store I went and bought a box of these mini moon pies - the perfect size!!  You don't feel as bad eating two of them because they are so small, and eating 4 of them is kinda like eating 2 of the bigger ones, not that I did that or anything.  haha  Go get your banana moon pies today - you won't regret it!!

summary: Flavor getting better, energy is great
review: I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.

summary: OK, not that flavorful
review: The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.

summary: Never again
review: I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.

review: The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item's page.  The worst part of it all was that when I attempted to return the case of "Soy Crisps", I was unable to do so.  Amazon said that this was a non-refundable item.  So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of "Soy Crisps" that I will not eat.

Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!

review: I am amazed at the consistent flavor of Melitta coffees. Seriously, I sip any Melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same. Not bad coffee, always a darker roast and a deep flavor, but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package. The Riviera Sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee, perfect for an after dinner treat.

summary: Good drink mix if you alter the directions a little.
review: I have been to New Orleans at one of the Pat O Briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant.  The key is  that the mix  makes twice as much as it says it makes, so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery.  So either use half as much powder or twice as much water, mix with your favorite rum(what they use), vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane.

review: The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles.

summary: Great Dog Food!
review: My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.

summary: Did not work for me
review: I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to "pop". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one "T", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped...

summary: Switch Flashback to my childhood - bad memories man
review: There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those "single shot" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.

summary: Good on Everything
review: I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)<br /><br />We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream.

summary: Best Treats Out There!
review: Annabelle (my three year old Persian mix) absolutely adores these. She does not like any other treats. These are perfect, because they're chewy, so they feel and taste different from her food. She does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out. Definitely try them. They are healthy (grain free) and perfect for any kitty! To the comment about the bag, just buy a treat jar. Works much better, and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter :)

summary: Teeny, Tiny Little Treats, But Good For What They Are, A Healthy Reward For Following Commands
review: We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his "treat", looked at it as if to say, "You've GOT to be KIDDING!" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, "Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."

summary: A Great Cuppa Tea:)
review: The company has been around for over 160 years, is the company that started PG Tips and started and owned Red Rose tea so you know you're dealing with a quality tea company. The flavor is very similar to PG Tips to me; but stronger. It's definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it's strength and you'll be happy that the milk doesn't 'water it down' in any way. With milk you'll still enjoy the full tea flavor; the milk only enhances the taste. It is a very strong tea, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it is a high quality, full flavored tea at an economical price. PG Tips is still my favorite but since I can't find it in my area but can find Brooke Bond Red Label at my local WalMart I'm a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to PG Tips...maybe it's just me, but I taste the similarity.  You won't regret trying this tea!

summary: Not as good as I was lead to believe
review: I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being "healthy" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well.

summary: Awful
review: The only other flavored coffee I've used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.<br /><br />Where the Nestle's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn't anything like hazelnut<br /><br />Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!<br /><br />More Info:<br />I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don't have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park.

summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

summary: It's decent
review: I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea - the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could "dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit." Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br /><br />This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin.

summary: Delicious
review: I can't remember when I've had a cup of coffee so delicious, I immediately wanted another cup.  There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut-with-a-touch-of-the-islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!

summary: Best Hot Cocoa for Keurig
review: As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.

summary: A yummy alternative to high-fat chips!
review: I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!

summary: Avoid like the plague---contains product killing honeybees
review: If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.

summary: Good alternative to regular orange soda
review: My daughter thinks this tastes like Sunkist Orange Soda, my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it (most of the can).  I thought it was okay (by I am not a fan of orange sodas); I would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor, like Grape, or Fruit Punch, or Kiwi Berry.<br />I think this is, of course, a much healthier alternative to any regular soda. And judging from my dautgher's and my grandson's experience with it, it would be hit with most kids.

summary: The real deal (ALMOST)
review: I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.<br /><br />If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind, this is it.<br /><br />I'll admit I do salt the bacon just a tad before I fry it.<br /><br />This is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon.

review: I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

summary: Great dog food!
review: I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!

summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
review: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

review: The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth.

summary: I'm a believer
review: I bought a Belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and I was then confronted with the question: What waffle mix do I use? Somehow "Hungry Jack" felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price, Stonewall would be a great choice. Bang! Nailed it the first time. Now, I don't know if my waffle maker is particularly large/deep, but I get only two and one half waffles out of each batch (following the recipe on the label). I don't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and I figure I only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can. The cost-per-waffle is steep, but these have never failed to come out light on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside, and they have NEVER stuck to the waffle iron. Grudgingly, even though I see the price has gone up a dollar per can, I will be reordering, but if it goes up any higher, I may have to try another brand.

review: I got the O.N.E. Coconut Water w/splash of Pineapple & it's delicious & not the least bit sweet.  Just very refreshing!!  LOVE IT and will continue using it.  Saw this on Dr. Oz as he recommended it.

summary: Stephen's Gourmet Candycane Cocoa
review: Well, I love hot cocoa but this is truly different. It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing "warm you from the inside out" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed.

summary: Great little mini popcorn!
review: I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!

summary: Yep, it works!
review: This product definitely works.<br />I was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half. After eating a whole tablet, I ate a lemon. It was WAY WAY too sweet!<br />I waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food.<br />I tried a 1/2 tablet the next day. I added some lemon to a glass of water. To me, it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda. It didn't taste like regular sugar. Which i guess is good. The sweet taste was just different.<br />I also ate cottage cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it.<br />The product works immediately by the way. No waiting for this to work.<br /><br />I think this product will last me a while.<br />The day after this review I took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1/2 tablet.I made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me. Not overly sweet, tasted like a lemon drop ;p<br />Your mileage may vary with this product.<br /><br />I've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one.<br />I just ordered a pack from another company. I will report back.<br /><br />I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I'm trying to lose some weight. I'm hoping these tablets will help me with that :)

summary: Plant in a Can
review: Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product.

Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.

review: We love to feed ours.  I chase flies and insects around the house sometimes just to watch them eat.  I would recommend buying some type of planitarium for them.  They need a warm humid space.  Only use distilled water.  NOT FILTERED!  These plants are very delicate when it comes to the water you give them.  I would even go so far as to buy a guide book.  Don't buy the "happy plants".  It's a good book for a kid. But it's not a guide on how to raise these plants. These plants are a great conversation piece for house guests.  Need I say more? ENJOY!

summary: Good water only comes with a price...
review: I continue to buy this water (as well as the larger size bottle) for a number of reasons:<br />1) The taste of the water is just plain good, refreshing, crisp and clean - it's not easy describing water that doesn't actually offend!<br />2) Our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues<br />3) The UPS guy does all the heavy work for me - all I have to do is put it away<br />4) I never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program<br />If I had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack.<br />Bottom line for me, the taste and convenience are worth the price and I'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows.**UPDATED note** I've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing: my local Kroger had Ozarka Spring Water on sale so I picked up a case - wow was that ever a mistake. Even though the Ozarka bottles are very light weight, the taste of the water is so different from TalkingRain Spring Water in that there is a distinct "plasticy" flavor. I've alway enjoyed the Ozarka in the past but had no idea I was settling for drinking "plastic" water...my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on TalkingRain Spring Water...I am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now.

review: I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it.  Now it seems assumed I will keep her in stock.  That alludes to a completely different product review.  The point is, buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home.  It seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least.  My only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers.  My GF usually gets what she wants.

summary: My cats go wild for this stuff.
review: I'd been feeding them Wellness until the recent recall. After checking some reviews, I looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot. They're always enthusiastic at mealtimes, but they've been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this. One caveat: Unlike the Wellness it has a pull tab, which is good news/ bad news. No need to mess with a can opener, but it's absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess.

review: My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat, egg and milk.  I was so upset when I found out but a little relieved as I started finding foods he can eat.  Yes, they are crumbly but they taste good, my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions.  Since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies I don't mind some crumbs!

summary: More Grammy Pot Pie Please!!
review: I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed "scrap" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to "re-label" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the "smaller" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at "perfect levels" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever! My only regret is that I did not start feeding my little four-legged one Merrick sooner!

review: I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor.

review: Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.

summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
review: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

review: I have a larger breed of dog, about 90 lbs and she loves these. At first they seem kind of hard, but she has no problem eating them. They don't take her very long to finish, but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy. My moms smaller dog, about 12 lbs also likes these, although the smaller ones are best for her.

summary: I love DisposaKups!
review: This product works just as described!  You simply place a filter in the disposable cup, add your own coffee, snap on the lid, and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular K Cup.  The coffee is just as good as any prepackaged K Cups, and you can use the brand of your choice at a fraction of the cost (and no washing out those pesky mesh reusable filters!) As some other reviewers have noted, sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that raises as you are trying to remove the used cup.  But you simply pull it out and I've never had a lid fall of, so there is still no mess.  I will definitely continue to use this product!

summary: Really Nice Taste!
review: I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.

summary: Excellent base mix
review: You can substitute nut milk, coconut milk or goat's milk or even soy milk for the 'milk' in this instant pudding.<br /><br />If you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding! If you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding! You can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin'! You are only limited by your imagination. This is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix (about a 1/3 packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid).

Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!

review: Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.

summary: Great quality food and my cats LOVE it.
review: I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain "Menadione Sodium Bisulfite" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.

summary: Superb paprika. Great for the Barbecue.  Do you know the origin of the word Barbecue?
review: Wonderful seasoning for the barbecue "rub" on chicken, meats, etc. Smoky paprika really enhances the flavour of the barbecued slow roasted delicacies.  Also gives it a very appetizing appearance.<br /><br />Fast shipping, good price, well sealed, no problems. Would buy again.<br /><br />Q: Do you know the origin of the word Barbecue?<br /><br />A: This word originated from the cooking methods of the Barbary pirates who ate most of their meals cooked outdors on an open grill/flame. Hence: Barbecue.

review: I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price.

review: My husband and I have been on a low carb diet for two years and I miss pasta most of all. We've tried other low carb pastas and weren't crazy about them, but we loved Fiber Gourmet. The taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta. Unlike other low carb pastas, we didn't experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues (if you know what I mean). I can't wait to try other products from Fiber Gourmet.

summary: It acutually tastes good!
review: If you only knew....<br /><br />Bisquick Gluten Free(GF) is by far one of the best options out there for people with Celiac or Sensitivity to Gluten.<br />I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...) We bout our own little frier<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016NQ49Q/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=talkinhome-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0016NQ49Q&adid=0XK6HZPJRKAED855HEWP<br /><br />In short, It has not only been a great option, but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that<br />it will taste bad to me.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful.

review: Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again.

summary: holy cheapness!
review: I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container.

summary: Heavily Flavored - Not For Us
review: I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn't go to waste.

summary: Great for Blood Pressure
review: I have been drinking three cups of this tea for the last month and a half.  I just had my annual checkup with my doctor and my blood pressure was 108/60!!!!  After years of it being it the 140's or 135's my blood pressure is now like a young person and I am in my sixties.  I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.

Hopefully this resource will not fade away.<br /><br />Joyce

summary: Popchips  variety box
review: I LOVE Popchips!!  These are the BEST.  Individual serving bags, flavors are great, taste is excellent.  My daughter and grandson love the barbeque.  I have found that buying them through Amazon is cheaper and Amazon offers the bigger bags also.  I have to watch that because I could eat the whole bag.

summary: Lots of benefits, especially for vegetarians/vegans!
review: Chia seeds are a versatile and amazing food.  These seeds from Navitas Naturals:<br /><br />1) Provide a very easy way get omega fatty acids -- your body cannot make Omega 3 fatty acids on its own and they are essential to cognitive health.<br /><br />2) Provide an easy way to get fiber -- not only does fiber help you feel fuller it can promote digestive regularity.<br /><br />3) Are easily incorporated into many foods you eat on a regular basis -- Chia seeds can be placed in oatmeal and smoothies.  Because they have a rather mild taste, you can even use them as sprinkles on a dessert. I've made a vanilla tapioca pudding with them. I also add them to salads.  Because chia seeds eventually turn into a gel if left in a liquid for a period of time, you can use them to thicken gravies.<br /><br />4)Are Vegan (and therefore vegetarian) -- Fish is how most individuals incorporate omega fatty acids in their diet.  These seeds are fish free.<br /><br />5) Provide energy -- Can be a great supplement to take before intense workouts or on days when you are feeling sluggish.  Let these seeds soak in some juice or low calorie coconut milk (like So Delicious)to help propel you through the rest of your day.<br /><br />6)Come in a bag that is resealable.  You don't have to struggle to close the bag; it opens easily and closes just as easily.

summary: Good way to try the different flavors
review: This 24-pack lasted about a month, and I sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wife's and my favorite. So, I reordered just the barbecue. Great snack for 100 calories. I've purchased the reduced fat Pringles 100-calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a Popchips bag than from Pringles.

review: The entire family loved this pancake mix. It was easy to make and tasted great. We tried it with syrup, powdered sugar, as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote. I would definately purchase this again. The only problem is my family wants this every weekend and I have to double to feed my large family. It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like.

review: This water is delicious. I'm not picky, but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle, delivered to your door, it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a-okay with me. Better than drinking a coke.

review: This stuff is the real deal! Not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, no fat, and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle.

summary: Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general
review: The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.

summary: Great for Barbeques
review: I've used La Tourangelle roasted walnut oil during the barbeque season for the past four years or so. It's a great product and I won't fire-up the hibachi without it. Along with various vinegars, I'll splash it on mushrooms, peppers and whatever veggies I have from the garden.  (The main dish is usually tofu, but I have a special marinade for that.)  One 500 ml can lasts me about one season while the other two keep well in the refrigerator. From what little shopping-around I've done I think the price would be hard to beat.

summary: Great grain free food
review: If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost.

summary: Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA
review: MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One�.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic� formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic� formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic� falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic� formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic� formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal.

review: Enjoy the taste, milk free product. Ilike milk in hot cocoa, just can't see adding powdered milk. B U T, it is considerably less expensive at a local chain grocery store in my area. I prefer a mix of this and Ghiradelli "Double Choclate".

summary: Really Nice Taste!
review: I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.

summary: Oh My Goodness~Reminds me of Girl Scout Cookies from 1960's
review: These are so good and also healthy for a snack. Only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories. When I was in Girl Scouts in the 60's there was a cookie like this Savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing. The first bite I took I was back there. It was so good. I love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double. I eat one everyday. They range from $2.98 to $3.89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go. I tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites.<br /><br />If you remember those cookies you will love these. If you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast. You will not regret it. YUMMMMMMMMMMY.

summary: Works with a caveat
review: In reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently.  At first I believed the tablets did nothing even though I used a whole one.  Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work, it just may not work exactly as advertised for you.

summary: I hope I just got a bad batch
review: This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was "natural flavor"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.

summary: Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!
review: I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a "salty" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.

summary: STALE.  Beware buying these on special!
review: I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same.

The blend of lemon, sweet, and pink are just right!!!  When I went back to get more mixes they had been relegated to the "Seasonal Clearance" section -- and I could only find 2 cake mixes and no more frosting.  = (  It's definitely a year round keeper -- I'm thinking granddaughter birthday parties, ballet recital parties, pinkalicious parties!!!

review: Bobby loves these treat so much and they work very well for hairballs. He has long hair and if he goes without these treats for a few days he is throwing up hairballs, and driving me crazy begging for his treats. I have been able to teach him to stay off of things by not giving him treats too. I  noticed that Bobby always chews them well so that may be the reason that some cats vomit.

summary: ABSOLUTELY VILE!!!
review: Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.

review: This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. A teaspoon in a cup is sufficient. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

summary: makes yummy pudding
review: I couldn't wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus I am trying to lose some weight. I've only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding.<br />1/2 cup coconut milk<br />2 tsbp chia seeds<br />1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (i used amazing grass chocolate powder 'cause it's all I had)<br />1 tablespoon cinnamon<br />1 tablespoon honey<br /><br />mix well in a container or small bowl, making sure to incorporate the cocoa powder.<br />Cover and place on a counter for about 30 minutes, stirring a few times.<br /><br />It will turn into a wonderful gelatin-esque yummy dessert!

summary: Great taste, less sodium
review: The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.

summary: Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced
review: I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.

summary: Excellent for Wheaten Terrier's Sensitive Tummies!
review: Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.

summary: Disappointed!!
review: I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the "sampler" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or "the lack of variety" pack!

review: A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , "these will change your life!"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.

review: I have been so happy with this product!  My baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy, up late hours w/ pains and crying with nothing to sooth her.  I finally found this product, our natropath suggested it.  My daughter loves it and it really helped her tummy!  Now, I wont giver her any other formula.  It organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area.  I found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door.  Id suggest this formula to anyone!

summary: Love this stuff!!
review: This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better.

summary: Good taste, bad product
review: I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

review: The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.<br /><br />My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.<br /><br />Great value for the price.

review: This one will not disappoint!  I got this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it.  I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups.

summary: Enjoyable flavor!
review: I got a 5 k-cup sample box of this coffee from Keureg, and I find that it is my favorite decaf coffee. It brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time. I add some 1/2 & 1/2 and a bit of Equal, and it is a treat any time.<br />Glad to have found this coffee.

summary: Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups
review: First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being "tangy" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's.

summary: Ugh.
review: This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no "delicious" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.

summary: The ONLY product that helps my cat with hairballs
review: My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system - he never spits them up.  I used to purchase them at the store, but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball/tartar control combo ones now - my cat hates them.  So happy to find these online!

summary: Awesome!
review: My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.

summary: Surprisingly delicious
review: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

summary: I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed
review: Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.

summary: Apfelsaftschorle for Americans
review: Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water.  The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting.  I usually drink any fruit juice this way now.<br /><br />Switch premakes my schorle.  The blend was and orange citrus rather than apple, but very good regardless.  I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice.  The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda.<br /><br />E.

summary: Better Than Expected
review: I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like "the real thing". Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box; very pricey and very small.

summary: Miracle? No. Fun? Absolutely!
review: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture.

summary: picky puppy...
review: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

summary: Great Chipotle Taste
review: We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.

summary: These cups melted during the coffee brewing process.
review: I was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled 10, for future brewing, with my favorite coffee.  I tried one right away...  the coffee started running down the front of my Kreuig.  I thought I had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough.... but when the coffee was done I opened the k-cup slot and found a melted wrinkled container.  I have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that I filled, after carefully checking that they were properly put together, and all melted in the same way.  I have since thrown the rest away because I was tired of the mess they created!  Don't buy these... they do not stand up to hot water.

summary: Real Truffle Oil makes a Difference
review: This is the first time I have found a US produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. A lot of other "truffle oils" just have "truffle aroma" (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well.

summary: Easy Now tea is great!
review: I put 1-2 teabags of Easy Now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20-30 min and have some before bed. No matter when I got to sleep, I always wake up 7-8 hours later, feeling good, and without having woken up in the middle of the night. (except maybe to use the restroom, but I always fall back asleep instantly) Its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves, it won't make you sleepy. This is easily my favorite calming tea.

summary: Bland
review: This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.

summary: Didn't care for the variety selections
review: I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.

summary: A Good Choice
review: This is a classic ramen choice.  Our kids, 3-6 love this.  When we're RVing, we have a case of this on hand.  A bowl, some water, and 2:30 in the microwave, and we've got our instant meal. We break up the noodles while still sealed in the package.  This helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them. They don't seem to tire of these; and we're not overly offended by the nature of the just-add-water-product. We each had our ramen-eating-college-days. These also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch, etc. at work.  Just make sure you have a pack of paper (not styro-save the enviro) bowls and some fork/spoons in that drawer, too.

summary: One of the Greatest Gluten Free Products I've Found
review: This is one of the most versatile mixes I've found, and most recipes come out tasting very much like the Full of Gluten Blends. I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains.<br /><br />Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix. YAY for Mom!<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!

summary: Kitty Junk Food
review: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review: I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own<br />#0174;Organics Advanced Dog Chicken & Rice Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag]]  Their only treats were Cheerios.  When I switched to Newman's Own brand, I was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting.  With all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry, I immediately thought "if I can't trust Paul Newman's foods, whose can I trust".  And, they love it.

summary: Great Cow's Milk Alternative & Easy to Use
review: My daughter is allergic to soy & cow's milk, but tolerated goat milk very well. She has been drinking it since she was 12 months. It's nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go. There is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website. After looking over the website, I felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter's nutritional needs.

summary: Wow that Expensive for coffee
review: This is by far the best Kona Coffee I've had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven't had any and I've been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I'd try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering, the coffee is amazing. Very smooth with great taste. I drink it both hot and cold. A pound makes a lot of coffee and while I didn't figure the price per cup, I still think it's worth it and will purchase it again.

summary: What a surprise
review: I watched an episode o "How Things are Made" on Discovery Channell and saw Bluegrass Soy Sauce featured.  On a whim, I ordered a bottle.  It took several weeks to arrive, but when it did - what a surprise.  My teenage son wanted to try it, and did.  He loved it immediately.  Now he puts it on many things. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much.  In the past, I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce (where virtually all of it is made).  What a treat to find a handmade American product, that competes with (and wins), against a Japanese/Chinese national staple!

summary: Perfect Condiment
review: I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!

summary: Great product - at last!
review: LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!

summary: Quick, easy and tasty!
review: Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product.

summary: Miracle? No. Fun? Absolutely!
review: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?

summary: Best David Seeds
review: The jumbo size is great, and makes for easier consuming.  Those of you Ranch heads like me, do yourself a favor and immediately upgrade.  This flavor is even better, easily the best David has to offer. Great price on Amazon, especially since these flavor seeds are pretty hard to find in regular stores.

summary: Uh, NO!
review: (First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any<br />attention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)<br /><br />This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotely<br />resemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff<br />is horrible.<br /><br />BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets.

summary: Good chips--nothing special
review: The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip.

summary: Good, but not the best of the Nana's varieties
review: I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.

summary: Simply Nasty
review: I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund.

summary: Delicious Meat Substitute
review: I have used Harmony Valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy. It is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture. When used in sauce or to stuff peppers I cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat. I was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use.  I can't wait to try it in other recipes.

summary: Some Variety
review: I have had the regular Donut House coffee before and enjoyed it, but I had never had the flavored kind.  I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This "Sampler" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:<br /><br />8 Donut House Regular<br />9 Donut House Decaf<br />7 Donut Shop Regular<br />9 Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Some sample.....

summary: Very Good Coffee
review: I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties. This was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees. So many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, this one was strong without the bad aftertaste, perfect for me!

summary: Inside of can corroded
review: After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response.

summary: Great dog food
review: We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....

summary: Awesome
review: I got the beans in the prescribed amount of time, and even before I opened the package I knew they were going to be great.  The amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only intensified after I actually opened the packaging.  I bought them explicitly to make my own vanilla extract, and I have to say they are some juicy beans.  I highly recommend them.

summary: A good soup on cold nights
review: This is my favorite Progresso soup. The broth has excellent flavor and it's not too salty. Yes the veggies could be a bit firmer, but the pieces are large and tasty. It has some heat already, but I  usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste. If I really want to indulge, I'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating - heaven!

summary: Worked great for my cat
review: This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more "grainy". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>

summary: Adzuki beans
review: Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins)  What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes.

summary: ABSOLUTELY VILE!!!
review: Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.

review: I had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place I could find it was amazon.com.  I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!

summary: Great Price for Great Sweetener!
review: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

summary: Now that's orange
review: This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.

summary: pleased with this recommendation
review: We tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. Took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. Coats are softer and glossy. Energy levels seem to be up. Quite pleased with the results so far.

summary: Great deal for a good product
review: The first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla.  The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28-32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there.

summary: my favorite cracker
review: These flatbreads are definitely my favorite cracker, but they're messy when I break them apart to have something closer to bite-sized.<br /><br />Caution: Despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues, people with celiac disesase cannot eat these. Spelt has gluten and the flatbreads contain barley malt. I love them and heartily recommend them, but please don't misunderstand the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Oh, yes, great price at Amazon compared to my local grocery store. I hope that advantage continues.

summary: Spectacular tomatoes
review: These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil.

summary: Horrible: did something happen?
review: I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.

summary: Full flavor, non-acidic, best K-cup so far!
review: I have been experimenting with K-cup brews for almost 2 years now.  I tried Timothy's Colombia Excelencia ONLY because it was on sale and I was still looking for THE ONE.  Well, I finally found it.  Columbia Excelencia is the best breakfast coffee I have found to date.  Rich, full-bodied, with a clean non-acrid finish.  It goes well with milk and Splenda, no odd aftertaste whatsoever.  Donut shop is my favorite over ICE, Newman's Nantucket is my favorite BOLD, Timothy's Italian goes best with dessert, and Colombia Excelencia is the first thing I drink every morning.

summary: best ever!
review: This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and "all the chemicals"--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need, such as levening, and when you use REAL butter, NOT the "tub" butter that contains water and other nasty stuff, these are THE BEST WAFFLES EVER!

summary: Earth's Best is the BEST
review: We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well.

summary: Not our favorite...
review: We have been experimenting with different brands of K-Cups since we purchased our Keurig last Christmas.  While this one was okay, it just is not as good Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend for an everyday staple.  We haven't tried Green Mountain Columbian yet as a closer comparison.  However, when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one, the brew is noticibly weaker than with GM Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />Also, please note that we LOVE Timothy's World Italian Blend!!  It is definitely amount our favorites.

summary: Bob's red mill pumkin seeds, Great product
review: This product is great tasting! I was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding USA made pumpkin seeds. The pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger.  I hope Red Mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the USA. It's worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local USA companies.

review: These cups are usable as stated.  They are exactly what I was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee.  They do leak slightly but not too bad. Not sure if it makes the hole's a little larger than the prepackaged cups.  But on the high side, I do get the have the coffee that I want, the way I want it. Which is great.

review: I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.

summary: You have to be Irish to appreciate this
review: I like it, it reminds me of food from my childhood. Not something I'd eat everyday.  Kinda like the way I feel about grits. You need to cook them for a long time. How you serve them makes all the difference in the world.  Great for baking, but you have to know the product before you try baking with it.  Taste?  Real wholesome, good stick to your ribs food, takes some effort like granola. Healthy eating?  Yes.

summary: An adequate product
review: I purchased this product in the hope of utilizing it to produce yogurt. The yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture.<br /><br />From the producers website<br /><br />"Note:  Goat milk yogurt is very thin, almost like kefir. For a thicker consistency, add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the scalded goat milk...."<br /><br />The product has a distinct aroma. Not terrible, but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk. The flavor of the milk was only acceptable.<br /><br />In a pinch this product will suffice, however; I would not personally recommend it for regular consumption.

review: I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!

summary: Great product
review: I have now owned this product for over a year and it is still going strong. I mainly use it for voice overs for YouTube videos, Skype calls, and recording music. It all works great.<br /><br />When I first received it in the mail, I simply opened it, plugged it in, and it worked. As simple as that. There were no drivers, no installation, and no updates. I just plugged my XLR condenser microphone into the Icicle and the Icicle to the USB on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a USB mic.<br /><br />This product was WAY lighter than I expected and feels rather cheap. However, that is not really an issue because the product works great. And the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal.<br /><br />The knob is also useful, as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, as it is plug and play. Very simple, and it just works.

summary: they are good (except for the "rainforest" flavor)
review: These taste very good, but aren't like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The "rainforest" flavor one is my least favorites (I don't recommend this particular flavor). has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it (don't get me wrong, I love cayenne, but not in a cookie!).... The "tropical" one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version (not a bad taste. Really good, actually!)... the "Original" is very great. I forgot the taste though, but I remember liking it..... "Alpine", in my opinion, is the best - it tastes like a European type of christmas cookie. it has a chocolaty (carob) taste to it, but not overly-sweet.

summary: Really Good Hazelnut Coffee
review: Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.<br />Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.<br />The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)<br />The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.<br />Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.<br />I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.<br />This one is a winner.

summary: Yep, it works!
review: This product definitely works.<br />I was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half. After eating a whole tablet, I ate a lemon. It was WAY WAY too sweet!<br />I waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food.<br />I tried a 1/2 tablet the next day. I added some lemon to a glass of water. To me, it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda. It didn't taste like regular sugar. Which i guess is good. The sweet taste was just different.<br />I also ate cottage cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it.<br />The product works immediately by the way. No waiting for this to work.<br /><br />I think this product will last me a while.<br />The day after this review I took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1/2 tablet.I made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me. Not overly sweet, tasted like a lemon drop ;p<br />Your mileage may vary with this product.<br /><br />I've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one.<br />I just ordered a pack from another company. I will report back.<br /><br />I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I'm trying to lose some weight. I'm hoping these tablets will help me with that :)

summary: Very Good Coffee
review: I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties. This was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees. So many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, this one was strong without the bad aftertaste, perfect for me!

summary: Better than the competition!
review: I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them.  My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy-free crackers are very hard to find.  I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them!  He prefers them to all other similar crackers.  I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly.

summary: I Still Like It Despite The Problems.....
review: As another reviewer noted when you heat this product in the microwave, you MUST keep an eye on it.  It tips; it pops and eventually spills all over.  However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.  Comparing the price per each on Amazon vs. a local store finds it much cheaper here on Amazon.  I recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too.

summary: all right by me !!!
review: These chips are some of the best I've had--ever! They're so good I dare say that they're addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.<br /><br />The main ingredient is whole grain brown rice; and yes, this is good for you. I haven't had regular potato chips in quite a while; but I would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have. There are no trans fats, no cholesterol, no preservatives, no and artificial flavors. They are even wheat and gluten free! Very good! They have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.<br /><br />They do have some sodium; they have about 200mg of sodium in every serving; and there are roughly five servings to a bag.<br /><br />If you have further questions, the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them. Good PR!<br /><br />Overall, these are some very awesome chips! I highly recommend them. Enjoy!

review: Beef sticks and honey - what a great combination! The Ole Smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. Adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. The Honey Stung Ole' Smokies are always a favorite with our friends; the saddlebag pack is a perfect take-along to football parties.

review: This coffee is surprisingly delicious. We never had a problem with the k-cups bursting; maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer..? This coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste. Look forward to my mug every morning. Would definitely recommend it and will buy it again.

summary: So Far So Good
review: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

summary: Flavored cofffee?
review: I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.

summary: Excellent tea!
review: This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box.

review: I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.

summary: Good Taste but Not for Everyone
review: I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.

Our dog loves the fruity part so much he licks them up!<br />A dog may be man's best friend, but these are definitely a dog's best friend!  Can't recommend them enough!

summary: Nice to find product thats safe
review: Our older cat is having some health issues, which I "suspect" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the "fish,chicken & liver" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the "seafood savory dinner". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them.

summary: Naturally Delicious
review: My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.

summary: Good Coffee - Great Price
review: I caught this as a "Warehouse" deal. $18.09 for 48 K-cups. This was my first experience with any Wolfgang Puck coffee.<br />The Rodeo Drive Blend is good, average coffee. Nothing exceptional. I prefer a little stronger, bolder coffee, but at this price, it works for me. There's other brands that I like a little better, but with K-cups, cost per unit is always something I have to factor in...<br />I'd buy it again @ $0.38/cup, but I probably wouldn't @ full price. If you keep your eyes peeled, you can always find a good deal... just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise.

summary: The "Replicator" of our time.
review: We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic "replicators", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station.

summary: Not quite Old Dutch but much better than Herr's
review: I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many "loaded" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!

summary: Delicious IMO and.... helps weight loss
review: If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- "De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight.

summary: Energy booster!
review: So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn't help.<br /><br />Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I'm not against it but I'm not a smoker and I've had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let's check Amazon and see what natural hemp products are available.<br /><br />First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you're interested, and it tasted like sand. It will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that's if I ever do. Then I tried this.<br /><br />I'm very honest in my reviews so I wouldn't recommend this if it didn't truly help. It's not a placebo-effect thing, either. I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me.<br /><br />The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels. I have done more around the house in the past few months than I've done in the past few years. I have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy hasn't gone away. I am a big and tall person so I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night, usually.<br /><br />Anyone who has depression/anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days. You get a heavy feeling like there's lead in your veins. If you've been through it then you understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I can say with 100% honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling. Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn't notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn't help, just don't buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me. I will take this supplement for the rest of my life, as far as I'm concerned. That's how much it has helped.<br /><br />I hope it works for you, too.

review: This is the only way to fry fish.  If you start cooking with your fire too high, the fish will not get those annoying burn marks.  The fish fries evenly, a nice golden brown.  It adheres to the fish well and does not come off when flipping to the other side.  It tastes good.  I add a pinch of old bay seasoning and a pinch of sugar, shake up the mixture and then add the fish and shake again.  We have been using this stuff for years and I make perfect fish every time.

review: this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this.

summary: Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!
review: I originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack.  When my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately.  It is super yummy waffle mix.  The waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them.  Here I am on amazon.com placing yet another order for this Waffle mix, it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone's favorite breakfast item.

review: Tasty, slightly different flavors then other brands, but good. In all other respects good purchase. Hard to find in US so I am not too picky.

summary: Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!
review: I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a "salty" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.

summary: Great Coffee
review: I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.

review: I really wasn't too sure this product would work.  It has surpassed all my expectations.  I will never buy the ready made K cups again.  This is truly a genius product!
